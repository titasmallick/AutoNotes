## Organs of the Digestive System and their Functions

The digestive system, also known as the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or alimentary canal, is a complex organ system responsible for the intake of food, its breakdown into absorbable nutrients, absorption of these nutrients into the bloodstream, and the elimination of indigestible waste products. It is a long, muscular tube extending from the mouth to the anus, along with several accessory organs.

1.  **Mouth (Oral Cavity):**
    *   **Function:** The initial site of digestion. It performs both mechanical and chemical digestion.
        *   **Mechanical Digestion:** Chewing (mastication) by teeth breaks down food into smaller pieces, increasing its surface area for enzymatic action.
        *   **Chemical Digestion:** Saliva, secreted by salivary glands, contains water, mucus (lubrication), and enzymes. **Salivary amylase (ptyalin)** begins the chemical digestion of complex carbohydrates (starches) into simpler sugars (maltose). **Lingual lipase** (though less active in the mouth) begins fat digestion.
    *   **Role:** Forms a bolus (a soft mass of chewed food) for swallowing.
2.  **Pharynx (Throat):**
    *   **Function:** A muscular tube that serves as a common passageway for both food (from the mouth to the esophagus) and air (from the nasal cavity to the larynx). During swallowing (deglutition), the epiglottis closes off the trachea to prevent food from entering the respiratory tract.
3.  **Esophagus (Food Pipe):**
    *   **Function:** A muscular tube connecting the pharynx to the stomach. It transports the food bolus through rhythmic, wave-like muscular contractions called **peristalsis**. This involuntary action pushes food downwards, regardless of body position.
4.  **Stomach:**
    *   **Function:** A J-shaped muscular organ located in the upper abdomen. It acts as a temporary storage reservoir for food and is a major site of protein digestion.
        *   **Mechanical Digestion:** Strong muscular contractions (churning) mix food with gastric juices.
        *   **Chemical Digestion:** Gastric glands in the stomach lining secrete **gastric juice**, which contains:
            *   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl):** Denatures proteins, kills most bacteria ingested with food, and provides an acidic environment (pH 1.5-3.5) necessary for the activation of pepsin.
            *   **Pepsinogen:** An inactive enzyme precursor, which is converted to active **pepsin** by HCl. Pepsin begins the digestion of proteins into smaller polypeptides.
            *   **Gastric Lipase:** Begins the digestion of fats, though its activity is limited in the acidic environment.
        *   **Result:** Food is converted into a semi-liquid, acidic paste called **chyme**.
5.  **Small Intestine:**
    *   **Function:** The longest part of the alimentary canal (about 6 meters in adults), divided into three sections: **duodenum, jejunum, and ileum**. It is the primary site for the completion of chemical digestion and the vast majority of nutrient absorption.
        *   **Digestion:** Receives digestive juices from accessory organs:
            *   **Bile (from liver/gallbladder):** Emulsifies fats (breaks large fat globules into smaller ones), increasing their surface area for lipase action.
            *   **Pancreatic Juice (from pancreas):** Contains a wide array of enzymes, including **pancreatic amylase** (carbohydrates), **trypsin** and **chymotrypsin** (proteins), and **pancreatic lipase** (fats).
            *   **Intestinal Juice (from intestinal wall):** Contains enzymes like **maltase, sucrase, lactase** (carbohydrates), and **peptidases** (proteins).
        *   **Absorption:** The inner lining of the small intestine is highly folded into **villi** and **microvilli**, which vastly increase the surface area for efficient absorption of digested nutrients (monosaccharides, amino acids, fatty acids, glycerol, vitamins, minerals, water) into the bloodstream and lymphatic system.
6.  **Large Intestine:**
    *   **Function:** A shorter but wider tube than the small intestine, divided into the **cecum, colon (ascending, transverse, descending, sigmoid), and rectum**. Its main functions are:
        *   **Water and Electrolyte Absorption:** Absorbs most of the remaining water and electrolytes from the indigestible food residue, converting liquid chyme into semi-solid feces.
        *   **Feces Formation and Storage:** Forms and temporarily stores feces.
        *   **Bacterial Activity:** Houses a vast population of beneficial bacteria (gut microbiota) that ferment some indigestible carbohydrates, synthesize certain vitamins (e.g., Vitamin K, B vitamins), and contribute to immune function.
7.  **Rectum:**
    *   **Function:** The final straight portion of the large intestine, serving as a temporary storage site for feces before elimination from the body.
8.  **Anus:**
    *   **Function:** The external opening at the end of the digestive tract, controlled by internal and external anal sphincters. It is responsible for the expulsion (defecation) of feces from the body.

## Accessory Digestive Organs (Not part of the alimentary canal but aid digestion):

*   **Salivary Glands:** Produce saliva, containing enzymes for carbohydrate digestion.
*   **Liver:** Produces bile, which aids in fat digestion and absorption. Also performs numerous metabolic functions.
*   **Gallbladder:** Stores and concentrates bile produced by the liver.
*   **Pancreas:** Produces pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes (amylase, lipase, proteases) and bicarbonate (to neutralize stomach acid). Also produces hormones (insulin, glucagon) for blood sugar regulation.

## Process of Digestion

Digestion is a complex process that involves both mechanical and chemical breakdown of food into molecules small enough to be absorbed into the bloodstream and utilized by the body's cells. This process occurs sequentially in different parts of the alimentary canal, with specific enzymes acting on different types of macromolecules.

### Carbohydrates Digestion

Carbohydrates, such as starches and sugars, are a primary source of energy. Their digestion begins in the mouth and is completed in the small intestine.

*   **Mouth (Oral Cavity):**
    *   **Enzyme:** **Salivary amylase (Ptyalin)**
    *   **Action:** Begins the chemical digestion of complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides like starch and glycogen) into smaller polysaccharides (dextrins) and disaccharides (maltose).
    *   **Note:** This enzyme is inactivated by the acidic environment of the stomach.
*   **Stomach:**
    *   No significant carbohydrate digestion occurs in the stomach due to the acidic pH, which inactivates salivary amylase.
*   **Small Intestine:**
    *   **Pancreatic Amylase:** As chyme enters the duodenum, the pancreas releases pancreatic amylase into the small intestine.
        *   **Action:** Continues the breakdown of remaining starches and dextrins into disaccharides (maltose).
    *   **Intestinal Brush Border Enzymes:** The lining of the small intestine (brush border) contains several disaccharidases:
        *   **Maltase:** Breaks down maltose into two glucose molecules.
        *   **Sucrase:** Breaks down sucrose (table sugar) into glucose and fructose.
        *   **Lactase:** Breaks down lactose (milk sugar) into glucose and galactose.
    *   **Absorption:** The resulting monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, galactose) are then absorbed through the intestinal wall into the bloodstream, primarily via active transport and facilitated diffusion.

### Proteins Digestion

Proteins are essential for building and repairing tissues. Their digestion begins in the stomach and is completed in the small intestine.

*   **Mouth:**
    *   No chemical digestion of proteins occurs in the mouth. Only mechanical breakdown (chewing).
*   **Stomach:**
    *   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl):** Denatures proteins, unfolding their complex three-dimensional structures, making them more accessible to enzymatic action. It also activates pepsinogen.
    *   **Enzyme:** **Pepsin** (activated from pepsinogen by HCl)
    *   **Action:** Begins the chemical digestion of proteins by breaking peptide bonds, converting large proteins into smaller polypeptides.
*   **Small Intestine:**
    *   **Pancreatic Proteases:** The pancreas releases several proteases into the small intestine, including:
        *   **Trypsin** (activated from trypsinogen)
        *   **Chymotrypsin** (activated from chymotrypsinogen)
        *   **Action:** These enzymes continue to break down polypeptides into smaller peptides and dipeptides.
    *   **Intestinal Brush Border Enzymes:** The brush border of the small intestine contains peptidases:
        *   **Aminopeptidases and Dipeptidases:** Break down small peptides and dipeptides into individual amino acids.
    *   **Absorption:** The resulting amino acids are absorbed through the intestinal wall into the bloodstream, primarily via active transport.

### Fats (Lipids) Digestion

Fats are a concentrated source of energy and are crucial for cell membrane structure. Their digestion primarily occurs in the small intestine.

*   **Mouth:**
    *   **Enzyme:** **Lingual lipase** (secreted by glands in the mouth)
    *   **Action:** Begins a very minor amount of fat digestion, primarily triglycerides, but its activity is limited.
*   **Stomach:**
    *   **Enzyme:** **Gastric lipase**
    *   **Action:** Continues the digestion of some triglycerides into diglycerides and fatty acids, but its activity is also limited due to the acidic environment and lack of emulsification.
*   **Small Intestine:** This is the main site of fat digestion.
    *   **Bile (produced by Liver, stored in Gallbladder):**
        *   **Action:** Bile salts emulsify large fat globules into smaller fat droplets (micelles). This physical process significantly increases the surface area of fats, making them more accessible to lipase enzymes. Bile does not chemically digest fats.
    *   **Enzyme:** **Pancreatic lipase** (released from the pancreas)
    *   **Action:** Breaks down emulsified triglycerides into fatty acids and monoglycerides (or glycerol and fatty acids).
    *   **Absorption:** Fatty acids and monoglycerides are absorbed into the intestinal cells. Inside the cells, they are reassembled into triglycerides, packaged into chylomicrons, and then absorbed into the lymphatic system (lacteals), eventually entering the bloodstream. Short-chain fatty acids can be absorbed directly into the bloodstream.
