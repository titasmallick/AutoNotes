## Habitat

**Definition:** A habitat is the natural home or environment of an animal, plant, or other organism.

## Adaptations of Plants and Animals to Different Habitats

Organisms develop special features or behaviors called adaptations to survive and thrive in their specific habitats.

### Aquatic Habitat

**Adaptations in Plants:**

*   **Floating Plants (e.g., Water Hyacinth, Duckweed):**
    *   **Characteristics:** Light and spongy bodies, air-filled cavities in stems/leaves to help them float. Roots are poorly developed or absent.
*   **Submerged Plants (e.g., Hydrilla, Pondweed):**
    *   **Characteristics:** Thin, flexible stems to withstand water currents. Leaves are narrow or finely dissected to offer less resistance to water flow. No stomata, gas exchange occurs directly through the body surface.
*   **Fixed Plants (e.g., Water Lily, Lotus):**
    *   **Characteristics:** Roots fixed in the mud at the bottom. Long, hollow, flexible stems to reach the water surface. Large, flat leaves that float on the surface with stomata on the upper side.

**Adaptations in Fish:**

*   **Streamlined Body:** Boat-shaped body to reduce friction while moving through water.
*   **Fins:** Presence of various fins (pectoral, pelvic, dorsal, caudal) for balance, steering, and propulsion.
*   **Gills:** Special respiratory organs for breathing underwater, extracting oxygen dissolved in water.
*   **Scales:** Overlapping scales provide protection and reduce friction.
*   **Swim Bladder:** An air-filled sac that helps fish maintain buoyancy at different depths.

### Desert Habitat

**Adaptations in Cactus (Desert Plant):**

*   **Spines:** Leaves are modified into spines to reduce water loss through transpiration and protect against herbivores.
*   **Fleshy Stem:** Stem is thick, fleshy, and green, storing water and performing photosynthesis.
*   **Waxy Coating:** A thick, waxy layer on the stem to prevent water loss.
*   **Deep Roots:** Roots spread wide and deep to absorb water from a large area.

**Adaptations in Camel (Desert Animal):**

*   **Hump:** Stores fat, which can be metabolized to produce water and energy.
*   **Long Legs:** Keep its body away from the hot desert sand.
*   **Broad, Flat Feet:** Help in walking on sand without sinking.
*   **Long Eyelashes and Nostrils that can Close:** Protect eyes and nose from sandstorms.
*   **Ability to Drink Large Amounts of Water:** Can drink up to 100 liters of water in one go.
*   **Tolerates High Body Temperature:** Can withstand significant fluctuations in body temperature, reducing water loss through sweating.

### Mountain Habitat

**Adaptations in Trees like Pine and Fir:**

*   **Conical Shape:** Sloping branches allow snow to slide off easily, preventing accumulation and damage.
*   **Needle-like Leaves:** Reduce surface area, minimizing water loss and preventing snow accumulation.
*   **Thick, Waxy Coating on Leaves:** Provides protection against cold and reduces water loss.

**Adaptations in Mountain Goat:**

*   **Strong Hooves:** Provide excellent grip on rocky, steep slopes.
*   **Thick Fur:** Provides insulation against cold temperatures.
*   **Agile and Sure-footed:** Allows them to navigate treacherous mountain terrain.

### Air Habitat

**Adaptations for Flight in Birds:**

*   **Streamlined Body:** Reduces air resistance during flight.
*   **Hollow Bones:** Make the body light, aiding in flight.
*   **Wings:** Modified forelimbs covered with feathers, providing lift and propulsion.
*   **Strong Flight Muscles:** Well-developed chest muscles to power the wings.
*   **Feathers:** Provide insulation, aid in flight, and give shape to the body.

**Aerial Plants (e.g., Orchids, Money Plant - when climbing):**

*   **Adaptations:** Develop aerial roots that absorb moisture directly from the air or attach to surfaces for support. They do not grow in soil.
