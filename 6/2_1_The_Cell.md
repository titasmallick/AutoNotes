# The Cell

The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of all known organisms. It is the smallest unit of life that can replicate independently.

## Plant Cell: Cell Organelles and their Functions

Plant cells are eukaryotic cells that differ from animal cells in several key aspects, primarily due to the presence of a cell wall, chloroplasts, and a large central vacuole.

*   **Cell Wall:**
    *   **Structure:** A rigid, outer layer made primarily of cellulose, located outside the cell membrane.
    *   **Function:** Provides structural support, protection, and maintains the shape of the plant cell. It also prevents excessive water uptake.
*   **Cell Membrane (Plasma Membrane):**
    *   **Structure:** A thin, semi-permeable membrane composed of a lipid bilayer with embedded proteins, located just inside the cell wall.
    *   **Function:** Controls the movement of substances into and out of the cell. It is selectively permeable.
*   **Plastids:**
    *   **Structure:** Membrane-bound organelles, including chloroplasts (containing chlorophyll), chromoplasts (pigmented), and leucoplasts (storage).
    *   **Function:** **Chloroplasts** are the sites of photosynthesis, where light energy is converted into chemical energy. Other plastids are involved in pigment synthesis and storage of food (starch, oils, proteins).
*   **Nucleus:**
    *   **Structure:** A large, spherical or oval organelle, usually located centrally, containing the cell's genetic material (DNA) organized into chromosomes. It is enclosed by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope.
    *   **Function:** Controls all the activities of the cell, including growth, metabolism, and reproduction. It is the control center of the cell.
*   **Vacuole:**
    *   **Structure:** Plant cells typically have one large, central vacuole that can occupy up to 90% of the cell volume. It is surrounded by a membrane called the tonoplast.
    *   **Function:** Stores water, nutrients, waste products, and maintains turgor pressure against the cell wall, providing support to the plant.
*   **Cytoplasm:**
    *   **Structure:** The jelly-like substance that fills the cell, enclosed by the cell membrane, and surrounds the organelles. It consists of the cytosol (the fluid portion) and the organelles suspended within it.
    *   **Function:** Site of many metabolic reactions and cellular processes. It provides a medium for the movement of organelles and substances within the cell.

## Animal Cell: Cell Organelles and their Functions

Animal cells are eukaryotic cells that lack a cell wall, chloroplasts, and a large central vacuole, which are characteristic of plant cells.

*   **Cell Membrane (Plasma Membrane):**
    *   **Structure:** A thin, flexible, outer boundary composed of a lipid bilayer with embedded proteins.
    *   **Function:** Controls the passage of substances into and out of the cell. It is selectively permeable and plays a role in cell communication.
*   **Plastids:**
    *   **Structure:** Absent in animal cells.
    *   **Function:** Not present, as animal cells do not perform photosynthesis.
*   **Nucleus:**
    *   **Structure:** A large, spherical or oval organelle, often located centrally, containing the cell's genetic material (DNA) in chromosomes. Enclosed by a nuclear envelope.
    *   **Function:** Controls all cellular activities, including growth, metabolism, and reproduction. It is the control center of the cell.
*   **Vacuole:**
    *   **Structure:** Animal cells typically have several small, temporary vacuoles, if present at all.
    *   **Function:** Involved in temporary storage of water, ions, and waste products, and sometimes in transport.
*   **Cytoplasm:**
    *   **Structure:** The jelly-like substance filling the cell, enclosed by the cell membrane, and surrounding the organelles. It includes the cytosol and suspended organelles.
    *   **Function:** Site of many metabolic reactions and cellular processes. Provides a medium for the movement of organelles and substances within the cell.

## Differences between Plant and Animal Cells

| Feature | Plant Cell | Animal Cell |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cell Wall** | Present (rigid, made of cellulose) | Absent |
| **Cell Membrane** | Present (inside cell wall) | Present (outer boundary) |
| **Plastids** | Present (e.g., chloroplasts) | Absent |
| **Nucleus** | Present (often pushed to periphery by large vacuole) | Present (usually central) |
| **Vacuole** | One large, central vacuole | Several small, temporary vacuoles (if any) |
| **Cytoplasm** | Present | Present |
