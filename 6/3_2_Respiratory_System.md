# Respiratory System

## Main Parts and Functions

The respiratory system is responsible for the exchange of gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) between the body and the environment.

1.  **Nose:**
    *   **Function:** Filters, warms, and moistens the inhaled air. Contains olfactory receptors for smell.
2.  **Pharynx (Throat):**
    *   **Function:** A common passageway for both air and food. Connects the nasal cavity and mouth to the larynx and esophagus.
3.  **Larynx (Voice Box):**
    *   **Function:** Contains vocal cords and is responsible for sound production (voice).
4.  **Trachea (Windpipe):**
    *   **Function:** A tube that carries air from the larynx to the bronchi. It is supported by C-shaped cartilaginous rings to prevent collapse.
5.  **Bronchi:**
    *   **Function:** The trachea divides into two main bronchi, one leading to each lung. They further branch into smaller bronchioles, carrying air into the lungs.
6.  **Lungs:**
    *   **Function:** The primary organs of respiration, where gas exchange occurs in tiny air sacs called alveoli.

## Difference between Respiration and Breathing

| Feature | Respiration | Breathing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Process** | Biochemical process (cellular level) | Physical process (mechanical) |
| **Energy** | Releases energy from food | Involves intake and expulsion of air |
| **Location** | Occurs inside cells (mitochondria) | Occurs in the lungs and respiratory passages |
| **Enzymes** | Involves many enzymes | No enzymes involved |

## Mechanism of Breathing

Breathing is a physical process involving two main phases: inhalation and exhalation.

*   **Inhalation (Breathing In):**
    *   **Diaphragm:** Contracts and moves downwards.
    *   **Ribs:** Intercostal muscles contract, pulling the ribs upwards and outwards.
    *   **Effect:** This increases the volume of the chest cavity, reducing the pressure inside the lungs. Air from the outside (higher pressure) rushes into the lungs (lower pressure).

*   **Exhalation (Breathing Out):**
    *   **Diaphragm:** Relaxes and moves upwards.
    *   **Ribs:** Intercostal muscles relax, allowing the ribs to move downwards and inwards.
    *   **Effect:** This decreases the volume of the chest cavity, increasing the pressure inside the lungs. Air from the lungs (higher pressure) is forced out.

## Common Respiratory Diseases

*   **Asthma:** A chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that causes difficulty breathing, wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness.
*   **Bronchitis:** Inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes, which carry air to and from the lungs, causing a cough with mucus.
*   **Pneumonia:** An infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs, which may fill with fluid or pus, causing cough, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing.
*   **Tuberculosis (T.B.):** A serious infectious bacterial disease that mainly affects the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body.
