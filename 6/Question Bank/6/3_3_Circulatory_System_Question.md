## Section C: Short Answer Questions (2 marks each)

1.  **Blood Circulation Process:** Oxygenated blood is pumped from the left side of the heart through arteries to the body's tissues. In the capillaries, oxygen is delivered and carbon dioxide is picked up. This deoxygenated blood then returns to the right side of the heart through veins, from where it is pumped to the lungs to be re-oxygenated.
2.  **Blood Composition:** Blood consists of **plasma** (the liquid matrix carrying nutrients and waste), **red blood cells** (for oxygen transport via hemoglobin), **white blood cells** (for fighting infection), and **platelets** (for blood clotting).
3.  **Arteries vs. Veins vs. Capillaries:** **Arteries** have thick, muscular walls to handle high pressure and carry blood away from the heart. **Veins** have thinner walls and valves to prevent backflow as they carry blood towards the heart. **Capillaries** are one-cell thick to allow for the efficient exchange of substances between blood and tissues.
4.  **Heartbeat and Pulse:** The heartbeat is the sound of the heart valves closing as the heart muscle contracts and relaxes. The pulse is the palpable pressure wave created by the heartbeat as blood surges through the arteries. Both are measured in beats per minute (BPM) and should be equal in a healthy individual.
5.  **ABO Blood Group System:** This system classifies blood into four types (A, B, AB, O) based on the presence of A and B antigens on red blood cells. Blood typing is crucial for transfusions to prevent an immune reaction where the recipient's antibodies attack the donor's antigens, which can be fatal.
6.  **Exercise Benefits:** Regular exercise strengthens the heart muscle, allowing it to pump more blood with each beat. It also helps lower blood pressure, improve cholesterol levels, and maintain a healthy weight, all of which reduce the risk of heart disease.
7.  **Hemoglobin's Role:** Hemoglobin is a protein within red blood cells that contains iron and readily binds with oxygen in the lungs. It is responsible for transporting this oxygen to all body cells, which need it for cellular respiration to produce energy. Without hemoglobin, oxygen transport would be insufficient to sustain life.
8.  **Blood Pressure:** Blood pressure is the force of blood against artery walls. **Systolic** pressure is the higher number, representing the pressure when the heart contracts. **Diastolic** pressure is the lower number, representing the pressure when the heart is at rest. It is a key indicator of cardiovascular health.
9.  **White Blood Cells (WBCs):** WBCs, or leukocytes, are the mobile units of the body's immune system. They are crucial for health as they identify and destroy pathogens like bacteria and viruses, remove dead cells, and are involved in the inflammatory response, protecting the body from disease.
10. **Blood Clotting:** When a blood vessel is injured, **platelets** rush to the site and form a temporary plug. They then release chemical signals that activate a cascade of clotting factors in the plasma, culminating in the formation of a fibrin mesh. This mesh traps red blood cells and platelets, forming a stable clot that stops bleeding and allows the wound to heal.
11. **Oxygenated vs. Deoxygenated Blood:** **Oxygenated** blood is rich in oxygen, appears bright red, and is found in arteries leaving the heart (and pulmonary veins). **Deoxygenated** blood is low in oxygen and high in carbon dioxide, appears dark red, and is found in veins returning to the heart (and the pulmonary artery).
12. **Heart-Healthy Diet:** A heart-healthy diet includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. It should feature lean proteins and healthy fats. Foods to avoid or limit include those high in saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and added sugars, as these can contribute to high blood pressure and clogged arteries.
13. **Universal Donor/Recipient:** **Type O** blood is the universal donor because its red blood cells have no A or B antigens, so they won't be attacked by the recipient's immune system. **Type AB** blood is the universal recipient because the plasma contains no antibodies against A or B antigens, so it can safely receive any blood type.
14. **Circulatory & Respiratory System Interaction:** The respiratory system is responsible for gas exchange with the external environment (breathing in O2, breathing out CO2). The circulatory system is the transport system; it moves the O2 from the lungs to the body's cells and transports the waste product CO2 from the cells back to the lungs to be exhaled.
15. **Regular Heart Rate Importance:** A regular heart rate (rhythm) indicates that the heart's electrical conduction system is functioning correctly. An irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) can mean the heart is not pumping blood efficiently, which can lead to fatigue, dizziness, or more serious conditions like stroke or cardiac arrest.
16. **Heart Disease Risk Factors:**
    *   **High Blood Pressure:** Forces the heart to work harder, straining the muscle and damaging arteries.
    *   **Smoking:** Damages the lining of blood vessels, increases blood pressure, and reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood.
    *   **High Cholesterol:** Leads to the formation of plaque in arteries (atherosclerosis), which can block blood flow.
17. **Heart as a Pump:** The heart is a four-chambered organ made of specialized cardiac muscle. It functions as a dual pump: the right side receives deoxygenated blood and pumps it to the lungs, while the left side receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it to the rest of the body. Valves ensure that blood flows in only one direction.
18. **Journey of a Red Blood Cell:** A red blood cell leaves the left ventricle of the heart, travels through the aorta and smaller arteries to a capillary bed in a body tissue (e.g., a muscle). Here, it releases its oxygen and picks up carbon dioxide. It then travels back to the heart through veins, enters the right atrium, and is pumped to the lungs to release CO2 and pick up fresh oxygen.
19. **Blood Pressure Regulation:** Blood pressure is regulated by a complex system involving the heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and hormones. The body can change blood pressure by altering the force of the heart's contractions, the diameter of blood vessels (vasoconstriction/vasodilation), and the volume of blood. Persistently high blood pressure (hypertension) can damage organs, while low blood pressure (hypotension) can cause dizziness.
20. **Blood Cell Life Cycle:** Most blood cells are produced in the bone marrow through a process called hematopoiesis. Red blood cells live for about 120 days, while the lifespan of white blood cells and platelets varies. Old and damaged red blood cells are primarily removed from circulation by the spleen and liver.
21. **Blood pH Balance:** The body must maintain a slightly alkaline blood pH (around 7.4) for enzymes and metabolic processes to function correctly. This balance is maintained primarily by the respiratory system (regulating CO2 levels) and the renal system (excreting acids or bases in urine), along with chemical buffers in the blood itself.
22. **Smoking and Cardiovascular System:** Smoking damages the cardiovascular system by damaging the inner lining of arteries, which promotes atherosclerosis. Nicotine raises blood pressure and heart rate, while carbon monoxide from smoke reduces the amount of oxygen that blood can carry. This combination greatly increases the risk of heart attack and stroke.
23. **Stress and Heart Health:** Chronic stress can lead to high blood pressure, inflammation, and unhealthy behaviors like poor diet and lack of exercise. The release of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline can, over time, damage blood vessels and increase the risk of cardiovascular events.
24. **Heart Attack:** A heart attack (myocardial infarction) occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart muscle is blocked, usually by a blood clot forming on a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. This deprives the heart muscle of oxygen, causing tissue death. Immediate treatment to restore blood flow is critical to minimize damage.
25. **Aging and the Cardiovascular System:** With age, the heart muscle may thicken and become less efficient, and arteries tend to stiffen (arteriosclerosis), which can lead to increased blood pressure. The heart's natural pacemaker system may also develop issues. These changes increase the overall risk of cardiovascular disease in older adults.

## Section D: Long Answer Questions (3 marks each)

1.  **Complete Structure of the Circulatory System:** The circulatory system is composed of the **heart**, a four-chambered muscular pump; **blood**, the transport medium; and a vast network of **blood vessels**. The vessels include **arteries** that carry blood away from the heart, branching into smaller **arterioles**; **capillaries**, microscopic vessels where nutrient and gas exchange occurs; and **veins** that carry blood back to the heart, formed from the convergence of smaller **venules**. This closed-loop structure ensures that blood is continuously and efficiently delivered to every cell in the body.

2.  **Complete Pathway of Blood Circulation:** The cycle has two main circuits. In the **systemic circuit**, oxygenated blood is pumped from the heart's left ventricle into the aorta, travels through arteries to the body's tissues, delivers oxygen in the capillaries, and returns as deoxygenated blood via veins to the right atrium. In the **pulmonary circuit**, this deoxygenated blood is pumped from the right ventricle to the lungs via the pulmonary artery, gets oxygenated in the lung capillaries, and returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins, ready to start the systemic circuit again.

3.  **Detailed Analysis of Blood Composition:** Blood is about 55% **plasma**, a straw-colored liquid that transports cells, nutrients, hormones, and waste. The remaining 45% consists of cells: **Red Blood Cells (Erythrocytes)**, which are packed with hemoglobin for oxygen transport; **White Blood Cells (Leukocytes)**, which are diverse cells of the immune system that fight infection; and **Platelets (Thrombocytes)**, which are cell fragments essential for initiating blood clots to prevent bleeding.

4.  **ABO and Rh Blood Group Systems:** The **ABO system** is based on the presence of A and B antigens on RBCs. Type A has A antigens, B has B, AB has both, and O has neither. The body produces antibodies against the antigens it lacks. The **Rh system** is based on the presence (Rh+) or absence (Rh-) of the D antigen. For a safe transfusion, the donor's antigens must not react with the recipient's antibodies. This makes Type O- the universal donor and Type AB+ the universal recipient.

5.  **Mechanism of Gas Exchange:** Gas exchange occurs via diffusion down a pressure gradient. In the lungs, oxygen is at a high pressure in the alveoli and diffuses into the low-pressure blood, binding to **hemoglobin** in red blood cells. In the body tissues, the situation is reversed: oxygen is released from hemoglobin and diffuses into the low-oxygen cells. Simultaneously, high-pressure carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism, diffuses from the tissues into the blood to be transported back to the lungs for exhalation.

6.  **Factors Affecting Blood Pressure:** Blood pressure is influenced by cardiac output, blood volume, and peripheral resistance. **Physiological factors** include heart rate, vessel elasticity, and hormones. **Lifestyle factors** like a high-sodium diet, lack of exercise, stress, and smoking can lead to **hypertension** (high blood pressure), which increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease. **Hypotension** (low blood pressure) can cause dizziness and fainting.

7.  **Diet and Cardiovascular Health:** A heart-healthy diet is crucial for preventing cardiovascular disease. It should be rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein, which provide vitamins, minerals, and fiber. **Foods to limit** include those high in **saturated and trans fats** (which raise bad cholesterol), **sodium** (which raises blood pressure), and **added sugars** (which contribute to obesity and inflammation). Healthy fats, like those in olive oil and fish, are beneficial.

8.  **Exercise and Cardiovascular Health:** Regular physical activity, especially **aerobic exercise** like running or swimming, strengthens the heart muscle, allowing it to pump blood more efficiently (lower resting heart rate). Exercise helps maintain flexible arteries, lowers blood pressure, improves the body's use of insulin, and helps manage weight. These combined effects significantly reduce the risk of developing heart disease.

9.  **Blood Clotting Process:** When a blood vessel is damaged, **platelets** adhere to the site and form a plug. This activates a complex cascade involving numerous **clotting factors** in the plasma. This cascade results in the conversion of fibrinogen (a soluble protein) into **fibrin** (insoluble threads). The fibrin threads form a mesh that traps platelets and red blood cells, creating a stable clot that seals the wound and stops bleeding.

10. **Major Cardiovascular Diseases:** The most common is **Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)**, caused by atherosclerosis in the heart's arteries, which can lead to a **heart attack**. **Stroke** occurs when blood flow to the brain is blocked. **Heart Failure** is a condition where the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Prevention for all involves managing risk factors like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking through healthy lifestyle choices and medication.

11. **The Cardiac Cycle:** The cardiac cycle is the sequence of events in one heartbeat. It consists of **diastole** (relaxation phase), where the chambers fill with blood, and **systole** (contraction phase), where the chambers pump blood out. The cycle is driven by an **electrical conduction system** starting at the **SA node** (pacemaker), which generates an impulse that spreads through the atria (causing them to contract) and then to the ventricles via the AV node, causing them to contract.

12. **Cardiovascular Adaptations During Exercise:** To meet the increased oxygen demand of working muscles, the cardiovascular system responds immediately. The **heart rate** and **stroke volume** (amount of blood pumped per beat) increase, boosting cardiac output. Blood flow is redirected from non-essential organs to the skeletal muscles. Blood pressure increases to ensure rapid delivery of oxygenated blood. Over time, training makes these responses more efficient.

13. **Atherosclerosis:** This is a chronic disease where fatty deposits, cholesterol, and other substances build up in the inner lining of an artery, forming a hard structure called **plaque**. This plaque narrows the arteries, restricting blood flow. If a plaque ruptures, it can trigger a blood clot that completely blocks the artery, causing a heart attack or stroke. Prevention and treatment focus on lifestyle changes (diet, exercise) and medications to lower cholesterol and blood pressure.

14. **Cardiovascular System in Homeostasis:** The circulatory system is central to maintaining a stable internal environment (homeostasis). It helps regulate **body temperature** by distributing heat and controlling blood flow to the skin. It transports buffers and works with the kidneys and lungs to maintain **pH balance**. It also regulates **fluid balance** by interacting with the lymphatic and renal systems.

15. **Fetal vs. Adult Circulation:** Fetal circulation is adapted for a non-breathing, fluid-filled lung environment. The fetus receives oxygenated blood from the mother via the **umbilical vein**. Special structures, like the **foramen ovale** (a hole between the atria) and the **ductus arteriosus** (a vessel connecting the pulmonary artery to the aorta), shunt blood away from the lungs. After birth, these shunts close as the baby begins to breathe, and the circulation transitions to the adult pattern.

16. **Aging and the Cardiovascular System:** As a person ages, the heart muscle may become thicker and less compliant, and the maximum heart rate may decrease. Arteries tend to lose elasticity and stiffen, a condition called arteriosclerosis, which contributes to a gradual increase in systolic blood pressure. These changes reduce the heart's reserve capacity and increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle can mitigate many of these effects.

17. **Heart Failure:** Heart failure is a chronic condition where the heart muscle is unable to pump blood effectively enough to meet the body's needs. It can be caused by conditions that damage or overwork the heart, like coronary artery disease or long-term high blood pressure. The body may try to compensate by enlarging the heart or increasing heart rate, but these mechanisms eventually fail. Treatment involves lifestyle changes, medications to improve heart function and reduce strain, and sometimes surgery.

18. **Cardiovascular System and Other Systems:** The circulatory system is the master transport system that supports all others. It delivers oxygen and nutrients to the **nervous system** to fuel brain activity. It absorbs nutrients from the **digestive system** for distribution. It transports waste products to the **excretory system** (kidneys) for removal. It also carries hormones for the **endocrine system** and immune cells for the **immune system**.

19. **Angiogenesis:** Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones. It is a vital process in growth, development, and wound healing. However, it is also a hallmark of cancer, as tumors require a blood supply to grow and metastasize. Research into factors that promote (for healing) or inhibit (for cancer treatment) angiogenesis is a major area of medical science.

20. **Emergency Cardiovascular Conditions:**
    *   **Heart Attack:** Caused by a blocked coronary artery. Immediate treatment involves calling emergency services, chewing an aspirin, and potentially CPR if the person becomes unresponsive.
    *   **Cardiac Arrest:** The heart stops beating effectively. Requires immediate CPR and defibrillation with an AED to restore a normal rhythm.
    *   **Severe Bleeding:** Requires applying direct, firm pressure to the wound to control blood loss until medical help arrives.

21. **Modern Lifestyle and Cardiovascular Health:** Modern lifestyles, characterized by **sedentary behavior** (desk jobs, screen time), high consumption of **processed foods** (rich in salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats), and **chronic stress**, have led to a pandemic of cardiovascular disease. These factors contribute directly to obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and high cholesterol, all major risk factors for heart disease and stroke.

22. **Cardiovascular Fitness Testing:** Cardiovascular fitness is often assessed with tests like the **graded exercise test** (stress test), where an individual walks on a treadmill while their ECG, heart rate, and blood pressure are monitored. Other measures include **VO2 max testing**, which directly measures the maximum amount of oxygen a person can utilize during intense exercise. These tests help determine heart health and prescribe safe exercise levels.

23. **Genetic and Environmental Factors in CVD Risk:** Cardiovascular disease risk is a combination of **genetic predisposition** and **environmental/lifestyle factors**. A family history of early heart disease is a significant, non-modifiable risk factor. Ethnicity can also play a role. However, these genetic risks can be significantly mitigated by controlling modifiable environmental factors like diet, exercise, smoking, and managing stress.

24. **Heart-Healthy Dietary Patterns:**
    *   **Mediterranean Diet:** Emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, olive oil, and fish. It is associated with lower rates of heart disease.
    *   **DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) Diet:** Focuses on high intake of fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy, and low intake of sodium. It is proven to lower blood pressure.
    *   **Plant-Based Diets:** These diets, which minimize or exclude animal products, are typically low in saturated fat and high in fiber, and are strongly linked to improved cardiovascular health.

25. **Innovations in Cardiovascular Medicine:** Recent advances include less invasive surgical techniques (e.g., transcatheter valve replacement), more effective medications like PCSK9 inhibitors for cholesterol, advanced imaging techniques for early diagnosis of atherosclerosis, and wearable technology (like smartwatches with ECG) that allows for continuous monitoring of heart health. These innovations are improving survival rates and quality of life for patients with cardiovascular disease.
