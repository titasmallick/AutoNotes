## Section C: Short Answer Questions (2 Marks each)

1.  **Carbohydrate Digestion:** Digestion begins in the mouth where salivary amylase breaks down starch. It ceases in the stomach's acid and resumes in the small intestine. Here, pancreatic amylase continues breaking down starch, and brush border enzymes (maltase, sucrase, lactase) break disaccharides into monosaccharides for absorption.
2.  **Stomach Structure and Function:** The stomach is a muscular organ that stores food, initiating protein digestion. Its walls secrete gastric juice containing hydrochloric acid, which kills bacteria and activates pepsin. The stomach's churning action mixes food with these juices to form chyme.
3.  **Pancreas Contribution:** The pancreas secretes pancreatic juice into the small intestine. This juice contains bicarbonate to neutralize stomach acid and a variety of enzymes, including amylase for carbohydrates, lipase for fats, and proteases (like trypsin) for proteins.
4.  **Bile's Role:** Bile is produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder. It is released into the small intestine to emulsify fats, breaking large globules into smaller droplets. This increases the surface area for pancreatic lipase to act upon, aiding fat digestion.
5.  **Protein Digestion:** Protein digestion starts in the stomach, where pepsin breaks proteins into smaller polypeptides. In the small intestine, pancreatic proteases like trypsin and chymotrypsin further break down polypeptides. Finally, peptidases on the intestinal wall break them into amino acids for absorption.
6.  **Small Intestine Functions:** The small intestine is the primary site for the chemical digestion of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, using enzymes from the pancreas and its own wall. It is also the main site for the absorption of most nutrients, water, vitamins, and minerals into the bloodstream.
7.  **Peristalsis in Esophagus:** Peristalsis is a series of wave-like muscle contractions that move food through the esophagus. Circular muscles contract behind the bolus to prevent it from moving backward, while longitudinal muscles ahead of the bolus contract to shorten the passageway, pushing it forward.
8.  **Villi Structure and Function:** Villi are small, finger-like projections lining the small intestine. They vastly increase the surface area available for nutrient absorption. Each villus contains a network of capillaries and a lacteal, which absorb digested nutrients into the blood and lymph respectively.
9.  **Large Intestine Contribution:** The large intestine primarily absorbs water and electrolytes from the remaining indigestible food matter. It also compacts and stores this material as feces before it is eliminated from the body. Gut bacteria within it also synthesize certain vitamins.
10. **Control of Gastric Secretion:** Gastric secretion is controlled by both nerves and hormones. The vagus nerve (neural control) stimulates secretion in response to the sight or smell of food. The hormone gastrin (hormonal control) is released when food enters the stomach, further stimulating acid production.
11. **Fat Emulsification:** Emulsification is the process where bile salts break down large fat globules in the chyme into much smaller fat droplets. This is crucial because it increases the surface area of the fat, allowing the water-soluble enzyme pancreatic lipase to access and digest the fat molecules effectively.
12. **Phases of Swallowing:** Swallowing (deglutition) has three phases. The voluntary buccal phase involves pushing the bolus to the back of the mouth. The involuntary pharyngeal phase involves the soft palate rising and the epiglottis closing the airway. The final esophageal phase involves peristalsis moving the bolus down to the stomach.
13. **Role of Digestive Enzymes:** Digestive enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up the breakdown of complex food molecules into simpler, absorbable units. For example, amylases break down carbohydrates, proteases break down proteins, and lipases break down fats, making them small enough to be absorbed by the intestines.
14. **Liver's Role in Digestion:** The liver's main digestive function is the production of bile, which is essential for fat digestion and absorption. Beyond digestion, the liver also plays a vital role in metabolizing absorbed nutrients, detoxifying harmful substances, and synthesizing essential proteins.
15. **Hormonal Regulation:** Digestive hormones like gastrin, secretin, and cholecystokinin (CCK) regulate digestion. Gastrin stimulates stomach acid production. Secretin stimulates the pancreas to release bicarbonate. CCK stimulates pancreatic enzyme release and gallbladder contraction, coordinating the digestive process.
16. **Nutrient Absorption:** In the small intestine, carbohydrates (as monosaccharides) and proteins (as amino acids) are absorbed into the blood capillaries. Fats (as fatty acids and glycerol) are absorbed into lacteals, forming chylomicrons. Water, vitamins, and minerals are also absorbed along the length of the intestine.
17. **Defecation Reflex:** When feces enter and stretch the rectum, stretch receptors trigger a spinal reflex, causing the internal anal sphincter to relax. Defecation is consciously controlled by the voluntary relaxation or constriction of the external anal sphincter, allowing for the elimination of feces.
18. **Stomach's Protective Mechanisms:** The stomach is protected from its own acidic environment by a thick layer of bicarbonate-rich mucus that coats the stomach lining. Additionally, the epithelial cells of the stomach have tight junctions to prevent acid from leaking, and they regenerate rapidly.
19. **Enterohepatic Circulation of Bile:** This is the recycling of bile salts. After aiding in fat digestion and absorption in the small intestine, most bile salts are reabsorbed in the ileum and returned to the liver via the portal vein. The liver then re-secretes them into the bile, conserving the body's supply.
20. **Small Intestine Motility:** The small intestine exhibits two main motility patterns. Segmentation consists of localized mixing contractions that churn the chyme with digestive juices and facilitate contact with the mucosa for absorption. Peristalsis consists of propulsive contractions that move the contents slowly along the intestine.
21. **Digestive System Adaptation:** The digestive system adapts to diet by adjusting enzyme secretion. For instance, a high-carbohydrate meal can lead to an increase in amylase production. Similarly, the composition of gut microbiota can change over time based on long-term dietary patterns, affecting how certain foods are processed.
22. **Large Intestine Microbiome:** The large intestine hosts a vast community of bacteria (the gut microbiome). These microbes help ferment undigested carbohydrates, produce essential vitamins like vitamin K and some B vitamins, and play a crucial role in training the immune system and preventing the growth of harmful bacteria.
23. **Digestive and Nervous System Coordination:** The nervous system, particularly the enteric nervous system (the "brain of the gut") and the autonomic nervous system (via the vagus nerve), controls digestive processes. It regulates motility (peristalsis, segmentation) and secretions from glands in response to stimuli like food presence.
24. **Common Digestive Disorders:** Common disorders include Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), caused by a weak lower esophageal sphincter allowing acid reflux. Peptic ulcers are sores in the stomach or duodenum lining, often caused by H. pylori bacteria or NSAID use. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is chronic inflammation of the digestive tract.
25. **Regulation of Pancreatic Secretions:** Pancreatic secretion is regulated by hormones. Secretin, released in response to acidic chyme in the duodenum, stimulates the pancreas to release bicarbonate-rich fluid to neutralize the acid. Cholecystokinin (CCK), released in response to fats and proteins, stimulates the secretion of digestive enzymes.

## Section D: Long Answer Questions (3 Marks each)

1.  **Journey of Food:** Food begins its journey in the **mouth**, where chewing (mechanical digestion) and salivary amylase (chemical digestion of carbs) create a bolus. The bolus is swallowed, passing through the **pharynx** and **esophagus** via peristalsis. In the **stomach**, food is mixed with gastric juice (HCl and pepsin), beginning protein digestion and forming chyme. The chyme is slowly released into the **small intestine**, the primary site for digestion and absorption. Here, bile from the liver and enzymes from the pancreas break down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, and the resulting nutrients are absorbed through the intestinal walls. The remaining indigestible material moves to the **large intestine**, where water is absorbed and feces are formed. Finally, feces are stored in the **rectum** and eliminated through the **anus**.

2.  **Protein Digestion:** The digestion of protein begins in the **stomach**. The acidic environment (due to HCl) denatures proteins and activates **pepsinogen** into its active form, **pepsin**. Pepsin breaks down large protein molecules into smaller polypeptides. When the chyme enters the **small intestine**, the pancreas releases inactive proteases (zymogens) like **trypsinogen**. The intestinal enzyme **enterokinase** activates trypsinogen to **trypsin**. Trypsin then activates other pancreatic proteases, such as chymotrypsin, and also continues to break down polypeptides. Finally, **peptidases** on the brush border of the intestinal cells break down the remaining small polypeptides into single **amino acids**, which are then absorbed into the bloodstream.

3.  **Liver Structure and Functions:** The liver, the largest internal organ, is located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen. Its digestive function is to produce **bile**, an alkaline fluid containing bile salts, which emulsifies fats in the small intestine, aiding their digestion. Beyond digestion, the liver has critical metabolic functions: it processes absorbed nutrients, stores glucose as glycogen, synthesizes plasma proteins, and metabolizes fats and proteins. It also serves as a primary site for **detoxification**, breaking down harmful substances like alcohol and drugs, and converting toxic ammonia into urea for excretion.

4.  **Hormonal Regulation of Digestion:** Digestion is regulated by several key hormones. **Gastrin**, produced by the stomach, is released in response to food presence and stimulates the secretion of gastric acid. When acidic chyme enters the duodenum, the small intestine releases **secretin**, which stimulates the pancreas to secrete bicarbonate to neutralize the acid. The presence of fats and proteins in the duodenum triggers the release of **cholecystokinin (CCK)**, which stimulates the pancreas to release digestive enzymes and the gallbladder to contract and release bile. These hormones work in a coordinated fashion to ensure enzymes and bile are present when needed.

5.  **Fat Digestion and Absorption:** Fat digestion occurs almost entirely in the **small intestine**. First, large fat globules are emulsified by **bile salts** (from the liver) into smaller droplets, increasing the surface area for enzymes. **Pancreatic lipase**, an enzyme from the pancreas, then breaks down these fat droplets into **fatty acids** and **glycerol**. These products, along with bile salts, form tiny spherical structures called **micelles**, which transport the fats to the surface of the intestinal cells. The fatty acids and glycerol diffuse into the cells, where they are reassembled into triglycerides and packaged into larger particles called **chylomicrons**. These chylomicrons are then absorbed into the lymphatic system via lacteals before entering the bloodstream.

6.  **Pancreas Structure and Function:** The pancreas is a gland located behind the stomach that has both exocrine and endocrine functions. Its **exocrine function** is crucial for digestion; it produces **pancreatic juice**, which contains a mixture of digestive enzymes (amylase, lipase, proteases) and bicarbonate. This juice is secreted into the small intestine to neutralize stomach acid and digest all major food types. Its **endocrine function** involves the islets of Langerhans, which secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream. These include **insulin** and **glucagon**, which are essential for regulating blood glucose levels.

7.  **Small Intestine Anatomy and Physiology:** The small intestine is a long, coiled tube divided into the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Its primary function is nutrient absorption, and its structure is highly adapted for this purpose. The inner wall is folded into circular folds (**plicae circulares**), which are covered in finger-like projections called **villi**. The cells on the surface of the villi have even smaller projections called **microvilli** (forming the brush border). These three levels of folding increase the surface area for absorption by over 600 times, ensuring efficient uptake of nutrients into the blood and lymph.

8.  **Neural Control of Digestion:** The digestive system is controlled by the **enteric nervous system (ENS)**, often called the "second brain," which can operate independently to control local reflexes for motility and secretion. The ENS is also influenced by the **autonomic nervous system**. The **parasympathetic nervous system** (primarily via the **vagus nerve**) generally stimulates digestion ("rest and digest"), increasing secretion and motility. The **sympathetic nervous system** ("fight or flight") inhibits digestion. Reflexes like the gastrocolic reflex (food in the stomach stimulates colonic motility) are mediated by this neural network.

9.  **Carbohydrate Digestion:** The digestion of complex carbohydrates (starch) begins in the **mouth** with the enzyme **salivary amylase**. This action stops in the acidic environment of the stomach. In the **small intestine**, **pancreatic amylase** continues to break down starch and glycogen into smaller oligosaccharides and disaccharides. The final stage of digestion occurs at the brush border of the small intestine, where enzymes like **maltase**, **sucrase**, and **lactase** break down disaccharides (maltose, sucrose, lactose) into their constituent **monosaccharides** (glucose, fructose, galactose). These simple sugars are then absorbed across the intestinal wall into the bloodstream.

10. **Stomach Structure and Function:** The stomach is a J-shaped muscular organ with four main regions. It acts as a temporary storage tank for food and is a major site for mechanical and chemical digestion. Its muscular walls perform powerful churning motions to mix food with **gastric juice**. This juice, secreted by gastric glands, contains **hydrochloric acid (HCl)** to kill microbes and activate enzymes, and **pepsinogen**, which is converted to **pepsin** to begin protein digestion. To protect itself from the harsh acidic environment, the stomach lining is coated with a thick, bicarbonate-rich **mucus layer**.

11. **Process of Defecation:** Defecation is the elimination of feces from the body. The process is initiated by the **defecation reflex**, which occurs when mass movements in the colon push feces into the normally empty rectum, stretching its walls. This stretching triggers a parasympathetic spinal reflex, causing the sigmoid colon and rectum to contract and the **internal anal sphincter** (involuntary muscle) to relax. The brain also receives a signal, giving the conscious awareness of the need to defecate. The external **anal sphincter** is under voluntary control, allowing defecation to be postponed until an appropriate time.

12. **Large Intestine and Gut Microbiome:** The large intestine's primary roles are to absorb water and electrolytes from indigestible food matter and to form and store feces. It does not produce digestive enzymes. It is also home to the **gut microbiome**, a complex community of trillions of bacteria. These bacteria play a symbiotic role by fermenting undigested carbohydrates, producing important nutrients like **vitamin K** and certain B vitamins, and preventing the growth of pathogenic microbes.

13. **Pathophysiology of Digestive Disorders:**
    *   **Peptic Ulcers:** Open sores on the lining of the stomach or duodenum, primarily caused by the bacterium *H. pylori* or chronic use of NSAIDs, which erode the protective mucus layer.
    *   **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD):** A chronic condition where stomach acid frequently flows back into the esophagus due to a weakened lower esophageal sphincter, causing heartburn and irritation.
    *   **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD):** A term for two conditions (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, leading to symptoms like pain, diarrhea, and weight loss.

14. **Digestion and Metabolism Coordination:** The digestive system breaks down food into absorbable nutrients, which are then used in metabolic pathways. For example, glucose absorbed from carbohydrate digestion enters the bloodstream and is used in **cellular respiration** to produce ATP. Amino acids from protein digestion are used to synthesize new proteins. Fatty acids are used for energy or stored. Hormones like **insulin** are crucial for this coordination, promoting the uptake and storage of glucose after a meal.

15. **Digestive System Adaptations:** The human digestive system is omnivorous, but it can adapt to different diets. For example, the secretion of digestive enzymes can be adjusted based on the macronutrient content of the diet. The composition of the **gut microbiome** is also highly adaptable and can change significantly based on long-term dietary patterns, influencing how different foods, especially fiber, are processed and the range of nutrients that can be extracted.

16. **Digestive System Development and Regeneration:** The digestive tract lining is one of the most rapidly regenerating tissues in the body, with a complete turnover every few days. This is accomplished by **intestinal stem cells** located at the base of the crypts of LieberkÃ¼hn. These stem cells continuously divide to produce new cells that migrate up the villi, differentiating into absorptive cells, goblet cells, and other specialized cell types, ensuring the integrity and function of the intestinal barrier.

17. **Immune Functions of the Digestive System:** The digestive system is a major immunological organ. It contains a large amount of **Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT)**, including Peyer's patches in the ileum. This system constantly samples gut contents to distinguish between harmless food antigens, beneficial commensal bacteria, and harmful pathogens. It mounts an immune response against pathogens while maintaining tolerance to non-harmful substances, a critical function for overall health.

18. **Digestive System and Other Body Systems:** The digestive system is intricately linked with other systems. The **circulatory system** transports absorbed nutrients from the gut to the rest of the body. The **nervous system** (both central and enteric) regulates digestive motility and secretion. The **endocrine system** coordinates digestion through hormones and is also influenced by it (e.g., gut hormones affecting appetite and insulin release).

19. **Molecular Mechanisms of Nutrient Absorption:** Nutrient absorption is a highly specific process. Monosaccharides like glucose are absorbed via **secondary active transport** with sodium ions (SGLT1) and facilitated diffusion (GLUT2). Amino acids are also absorbed by various active transport mechanisms. Fatty acids and monoglycerides diffuse into intestinal cells, while water is absorbed by osmosis, following the osmotic gradient created by the absorption of solutes.

20. **Regulation of Digestive Enzyme Secretion:** Most digestive enzymes are stored and secreted as inactive precursors called **zymogens** (e.g., pepsinogen, trypsinogen) to prevent them from digesting the cells that produce them. Activation occurs only in the lumen of the GI tract where they are needed. For example, pepsinogen is activated by HCl in the stomach, and trypsinogen is activated by enterokinase in the small intestine. This activation is often a cascade, where one active enzyme activates others, providing a rapid and amplified response.

21. **Digestive System in Homeostasis:** The digestive system is vital for maintaining homeostasis. It regulates **fluid and electrolyte balance** by absorbing water and minerals from the diet. It plays a role in **pH regulation** through the secretion of bicarbonate by the pancreas to neutralize stomach acid. Most importantly, it provides a constant supply of **nutrients** to the blood, which is essential for the energy and building blocks required by all body cells to function.

22. **Evolutionary Adaptations:** Compared to herbivorous mammals, which have long and complex digestive tracts with fermentation chambers to break down cellulose, the human digestive system is shorter and simpler, reflecting an omnivorous diet. The human gut lacks the enzyme cellulase. However, compared to carnivores, the human small intestine is relatively long, allowing for efficient absorption of nutrients from plant matter.

23. **Pharmacological Aspects of Digestion:** Many drugs target the digestive system. For example, **proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)** reduce the production of stomach acid to treat GERD and ulcers. **Laxatives** increase gut motility or water content in feces to treat constipation. The GI tract is also a major site for the absorption of most orally administered drugs, and factors like stomach pH and food presence can significantly affect how well a drug is absorbed.

24. **Diagnostic Methods for Digestive System:** Digestive function is assessed using various methods. **Endoscopy** (upper GI) and **colonoscopy** (lower GI) involve using a flexible camera to visualize the lining of the digestive tract and take biopsies. **Barium swallows** or **enemas** use a contrast agent to visualize the GI tract on X-rays. Stool samples can be analyzed for blood, fat, or pathogens, and blood tests can check for liver enzymes or markers of inflammation.

25. **Surgical Interventions on the Digestive System:** Common surgical interventions include **appendectomy** (removal of the appendix), **cholecystectomy** (removal of the gallbladder), and **colectomy** (removal of all or part of the colon), often for cancer or IBD. **Bariatric surgery** (e.g., gastric bypass) alters the stomach and small intestine to induce weight loss. These surgeries can have significant physiological consequences, such as altered nutrient absorption (malabsorption) or changes in bowel habits.
