## Section C: Short Answer Questions (2 marks each)

1.  **Describe the structure and function of the androecium.**
    The androecium is the male reproductive whorl of a flower, consisting of units called stamens. Each stamen is made of a stalk-like filament that supports an anther, which is a sac-like structure that produces and contains pollen grains. The primary function of the androecium is to produce male gametes within these pollen grains for fertilization.

2.  **Explain the structure and function of the gynoecium.**
    The gynoecium is the female reproductive whorl at the center of the flower, consisting of one or more carpels (or a pistil). Each carpel has three parts: the stigma (a receptive tip for pollen), the style (a stalk connecting the stigma to the ovary), and the ovary (a base containing ovules). Its function is to receive pollen and contain the ovules, which develop into seeds after fertilization.

3.  **Compare self-pollination and cross-pollination with one example each.**
    Self-pollination is the transfer of pollen to the stigma of the same flower or another flower on the same plant (e.g., Pea). Cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen from a flower on one plant to the stigma of a flower on another plant of the same species (e.g., Rose). Self-pollination leads to genetic uniformity, while cross-pollination promotes genetic diversity.

4.  **Describe the characteristics of wind-pollinated flowers with two examples.**
    Wind-pollinated (anemophilous) flowers are typically small, inconspicuous, and dull-colored, lacking scent and nectar. They produce large quantities of light, dry pollen to be easily carried by the wind, and their stigmas are often large and feathery to effectively trap airborne pollen. Examples include Maize and Grasses.

5.  **Describe the characteristics of insect-pollinated flowers with two examples.**
    Insect-pollinated (entomophilous) flowers are usually large, brightly colored, and fragrant to attract insects. They often produce nectar as a reward and have sticky or spiny pollen that adheres to insect bodies. Their stigmas are also often sticky to receive the pollen. Examples include Rose and Sunflower.

6.  **Explain the process of fertilization in flowering plants.**
    After a pollen grain lands on a compatible stigma (pollination), it germinates and grows a pollen tube down through the style to the ovary. The male gametes travel down this tube to an ovule. Fertilization occurs when one male gamete fuses with the female gamete (egg cell) inside the ovule to form a zygote.

7.  **Describe what happens to different parts of the flower after fertilization.**
    After fertilization, the ovary develops into the fruit, and the ovules inside it develop into seeds. The other floral parts, including the sepals, petals, stamens, style, and stigma, typically wither and fall off as they are no longer needed.

8.  **Differentiate between dry fruits and fleshy fruits with examples.**
    The main difference lies in the nature of the pericarp (fruit wall) at maturity. In dry fruits, the pericarp becomes dry and hard (e.g., Pea pod, Wheat). In fleshy fruits, the pericarp remains fleshy and juicy (e.g., Mango, Tomato).

9.  **Describe the three layers of pericarp in fleshy fruits.**
    The pericarp of fleshy fruits has three layers. The **epicarp** is the outermost protective skin or peel. The **mesocarp** is the middle, fleshy, and often edible part that stores food. The **endocarp** is the innermost layer that encloses the seed(s) and can be hard and stony (like in a mango) or membranous (like in an orange).

10. **Compare monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous seeds with examples.**
    Monocotyledonous (monocot) seeds have a single cotyledon (e.g., Maize, Rice), and food is typically stored in the endosperm. Dicotyledonous (dicot) seeds have two cotyledons (e.g., Bean, Pea), which usually store the food for the embryo.

11. **Explain the conditions required for seed germination and why each is important.**
    Three conditions are essential for germination. **Moisture** is needed to soften the seed coat and activate enzymes. **Warmth** (a suitable temperature) is required for these enzymes to function optimally. **Air (Oxygen)** is necessary for the embryo to respire and release energy for growth.

12. **Compare epigeal and hypogeal germination with examples.**
    In epigeal germination, the cotyledons are pushed above the ground by the elongating hypocotyl (e.g., Bean). In hypogeal germination, the cotyledon(s) remain below the soil surface while the plumule emerges (e.g., Maize).

13. **Describe the structure of a seed and the function of each part.**
    A seed consists of a **seed coat** for protection, an **embryo** (the miniature plant), and stored food. The embryo has a **radicle** that develops into the root and a **plumule** that develops into the shoot. The **cotyledon(s)** store or transfer food to the embryo.

14. **Explain how wind pollination is adapted in flowering plants.**
    Plants adapted for wind pollination produce vast amounts of lightweight, dry pollen to maximize chances of dispersal. Their flowers are often small and lack petals, scent, or nectar, and they possess large, feathery stigmas to efficiently trap the wind-borne pollen.

15. **Explain how insect pollination is adapted in flowering plants.**
    Plants adapted for insect pollination have evolved features to attract pollinators. These include large, colorful petals, strong fragrances, and the production of nectar. Their pollen is often sticky or spiny to attach to insects, and stigmas are sticky to receive it.

16. **Describe the journey of pollen from anther to fertilization.**
    Pollen is released from the anther and transferred to a stigma by a pollinating agent. On the stigma, it germinates, growing a pollen tube through the style towards the ovary. Male gametes travel down the tube, enter an ovule, and one fuses with the egg cell, completing fertilization.

17. **Explain the importance of cross-pollination over self-pollination.**
    Cross-pollination is more important because it involves the fusion of gametes from two different parent plants, leading to genetic variation in the offspring. This genetic diversity increases the chances of adaptation and survival of the species in changing environmental conditions, whereas self-pollination leads to genetic uniformity.

18. **Describe the formation of fruit from flower after fertilization.**
    Following fertilization, the ovary of the flower begins to swell and mature into the fruit. The wall of the ovary develops into the pericarp (fruit wall). Simultaneously, the ovules inside the ovary develop into seeds, while other floral parts like petals and stamens wither away.

19. **Explain the role of different agents in cross-pollination.**
    Cross-pollination requires agents to transfer pollen between plants. **Wind** carries light, dry pollen over distances. **Insects** are attracted by colorful, scented flowers and transfer sticky pollen as they feed on nectar. **Water** can carry the pollen of some aquatic plants.

20. **Describe the structure of embryo and function of its parts.**
    The embryo is the young plant within a seed. It consists of the **radicle**, the embryonic root that grows downwards to form the root system, and the **plumule**, the embryonic shoot that grows upwards to form the stem and leaves. It also includes one or two **cotyledons**, which provide nourishment.

21. **Explain how water-pollinated flowers are adapted for their mode of pollination.**
    Water-pollinated (hydrophilous) flowers are typically small and inconspicuous. They produce pollen that is light and unwettable, allowing it to float on or in the water without being damaged, eventually reaching the stigma of another flower. Examples include Vallisneria and Hydrilla.

22. **Compare the pollen characteristics of wind and insect-pollinated flowers.**
    Pollen from wind-pollinated flowers is small, light, dry, and produced in very large quantities to be easily carried by air currents. In contrast, pollen from insect-pollinated flowers is larger, sticky or spiny to adhere to insect bodies, and produced in smaller quantities.

23. **Describe the changes that occur in a flower after successful pollination and fertilization.**
    After fertilization, the zygote develops into an embryo. The ovule turns into a seed, and the ovary wall develops into the fruit (pericarp). The sepals, petals, stamens, stigma, and style wither and fall off, as their functions are complete.

24. **Explain the significance of cotyledons in seed germination.**
    Cotyledons are vital for germination as they provide the initial food source for the growing embryo. In dicots, they store food directly, while in monocots, they help transfer food from the endosperm. This nourishment sustains the seedling until it can produce its own food through photosynthesis.

25. **Describe how the structure of different types of fruits helps in seed protection and dispersal.**
    Fleshy, edible fruits attract animals, which eat the fruit and disperse the seeds in their droppings. Dry, winged fruits (like in maples) are adapted for wind dispersal. Fruits with hooks or barbs (like burrs) attach to animal fur for dispersal, while buoyant, waterproof fruits can be dispersed by water.

## Section D: Long Answer Questions (3 marks each)

1.  **Describe the four whorls of a flower in detail, including their structure and functions.**
    A typical flower has four whorls arranged on the receptacle.
    1.  **Calyx:** The outermost whorl, composed of green, leaf-like **sepals**. Its primary function is to protect the flower during its bud stage.
    2.  **Corolla:** The whorl inside the calyx, composed of often brightly colored **petals**. Its main function is to attract pollinators like insects and birds through its color, scent, and nectar guides.
    3.  **Androecium:** The male reproductive part, consisting of **stamens**. Each stamen has a **filament** (stalk) and an **anther** (sac) that produces and contains pollen grains, which hold the male gametes.
    4.  **Gynoecium:** The innermost, female reproductive part, consisting of one or more **carpels** (pistil). Each carpel has a **stigma** (receives pollen), a **style** (connects stigma to ovary), and an **ovary** (contains ovules). Its function is to produce the female gametes within ovules and to house the developing seeds after fertilization.

2.  **Explain the different types of pollination and describe the adaptations of flowers for each type.**
    Pollination is the transfer of pollen from anther to stigma. There are two main types:
    *   **Self-Pollination:** Pollen is transferred within the same flower or to another flower on the same plant. Flowers adapted for this are often small and may not have prominent attractive features.
    *   **Cross-Pollination:** Pollen is transferred from one plant to another of the same species. This requires external agents, and flowers show specific adaptations:
        *   **Wind Pollination (Anemophily):** Flowers are small, dull, and lack nectar/scent. They produce huge amounts of light, dry pollen and have large, feathery stigmas (e.g., Maize).
        *   **Insect Pollination (Entomophily):** Flowers are large, colorful, fragrant, and produce nectar to attract insects. Pollen is sticky or spiny to adhere to insects (e.g., Rose).
        *   **Water Pollination (Hydrophily):** Flowers are small and inconspicuous. Pollen is light and unwettable to be carried by water (e.g., Vallisneria).

3.  **Describe the complete process of fertilization in flowering plants, from pollination to zygote formation.**
    The process begins with **pollination**, where a pollen grain lands on the receptive stigma of a compatible flower. The pollen grain then absorbs moisture and **germinates**, growing a thin **pollen tube**. This tube grows down through the style, guided by chemical signals, towards the ovary. Inside the pollen grain are two male gametes. These gametes travel down the pollen tube, which eventually penetrates an **ovule** within the ovary. Finally, **fertilization** occurs when one of the male gametes fuses with the female gamete (egg cell) inside the ovule. This fusion results in the formation of a diploid **zygote**, which is the first cell of the new embryo.

4.  **Explain the formation of fruits and seeds after fertilization, describing the changes in different flower parts.**
    After fertilization is complete, the flower undergoes significant transformation to produce fruits and seeds.
    *   **Ovary to Fruit:** The primary change is the development of the ovary into the **fruit**. The wall of the ovary thickens and differentiates to become the **pericarp** (the wall of the fruit), which may be fleshy or dry.
    *   **Ovules to Seeds:** The **ovules** contained within the ovary develop into **seeds**. The fertilized egg inside the ovule grows into the **embryo**, and the ovule walls harden to form the protective **seed coat**.
    *   **Other Floral Parts:** The remaining parts of the flower, which have served their purpose, wither and fall off. This includes the **petals**, **sepals**, **stamens**, **stigma**, and **style**. Their nutrients are often reabsorbed by the plant to support the growing fruit and seeds.

5.  **Compare and contrast the characteristics of wind-pollinated and insect-pollinated flowers with suitable examples.**
    **Contrast:**
    *   **Attractants:** Insect-pollinated flowers are large, colorful, and scented to attract pollinators (e.g., Sunflower), while wind-pollinated flowers are small, dull, and unscented as they don't need to attract animals (e.g., Grasses).
    *   **Pollen:** Insect-pollinated flowers produce smaller amounts of large, sticky/spiny pollen. Wind-pollinated flowers produce vast quantities of small, light, dry pollen.
    *   **Stigma:** Insect-pollinated flowers have sticky stigmas to receive pollen from insects. Wind-pollinated flowers have large, feathery stigmas to trap airborne pollen.
    *   **Nectar:** Nectar is present in insect-pollinated flowers as a reward but absent in wind-pollinated ones.
    **Comparison:**
    *   Both are mechanisms of cross-pollination designed to transfer pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another, ensuring sexual reproduction.

6.  **Describe the structure of a seed and explain the process of germination with necessary conditions.**
    A **seed** is a fertilized ovule containing an embryo and stored food, protected by a seed coat. Its main parts are the **seed coat** (outer protection), the **embryo** (miniature plant with a radicle/embryonic root and plumule/embryonic shoot), and **cotyledons** (seed leaves that store food).
    **Germination** is the process where the embryo sprouts into a seedling. For this to occur, three conditions are necessary:
    1.  **Moisture (Water):** It softens the seed coat and activates enzymes that break down stored food.
    2.  **Warmth (Suitable Temperature):** Enzymes function best at an optimal temperature, allowing metabolic processes to occur.
    3.  **Air (Oxygen):** Oxygen is required for aerobic respiration, which releases the energy needed for the embryo to grow and emerge from the seed.

7.  **Explain the different types of seed germination with examples and describe what happens during each type.**
    There are two main types of seed germination based on the fate of the cotyledons.
    1.  **Epigeal Germination:** In this type, the hypocotyl (the stem part below the cotyledons) elongates rapidly, pushing the cotyledons and the plumule above the soil surface. The cotyledons may then turn green and photosynthesize before withering. An example is the **Bean seed**.
    2.  **Hypogeal Germination:** In this type, the epicotyl (the stem part above the cotyledons) elongates, while the cotyledons remain below the soil surface. The cotyledons serve only as a food source and do not emerge from the ground. An example is the **Maize seed**.

8.  **Describe the structure and classification of fruits, explaining the significance of different fruit types.**
    A **fruit** is a mature, ripened ovary that encloses the seed or seeds. Its wall, the **pericarp**, has three layers: the outer **epicarp**, middle **mesocarp**, and inner **endocarp**.
    Fruits are broadly classified into:
    *   **Fleshy Fruits:** The pericarp is thick and juicy at maturity. They are significant because their fleshy nature attracts animals, which eat them and help in **seed dispersal** over long distances. Examples include **Mango** and **Tomato**.
    *   **Dry Fruits:** The pericarp is dry and hard at maturity. Their significance lies in protection and varied dispersal mechanisms. Some split open to release seeds (e.g., **Pea pod**), while others are adapted for dispersal by wind or other means (e.g., **Groundnut**, **Wheat**).

9.  **Explain the agents of cross-pollination and describe the adaptations of flowers for each agent.**
    Cross-pollination relies on external agents to move pollen between plants.
    1.  **Wind (Anemophily):** Flowers are adapted by being small, inconspicuous, and lacking attractants. They produce enormous amounts of light, dry pollen and have large, feathery stigmas to catch it (e.g., Pine, Grasses).
    2.  **Insects (Entomophily):** Flowers are adapted to attract insects with large, colorful petals, fragrance, and nectar. They produce sticky pollen that adheres to the insect's body and have sticky stigmas to receive it (e.g., Hibiscus, Pea).
    3.  **Water (Hydrophily):** This is rare and occurs in aquatic plants. Flowers are small, and the pollen is light and protected from water by a waxy coating, allowing it to float to other flowers (e.g., Hydrilla, Vallisneria).

10. **Describe the male and female reproductive parts of a flower and explain their roles in reproduction.**
    *   **Male Reproductive Part (Androecium):** This whorl is composed of **stamens**. Each stamen consists of a slender **filament** that holds up an **anther**. The role of the anther is crucial: it produces and stores **pollen grains**. Each pollen grain contains the male gametes necessary for fertilization. The filament's role is to position the anther effectively for pollen dispersal.
    *   **Female Reproductive Part (Gynoecium):** This is the central whorl, composed of one or more **carpels** (or a pistil). It has three parts. The **stigma** is the receptive tip, whose role is to trap pollen. The **style** is a stalk that connects the stigma to the ovary, providing a path for the pollen tube. The **ovary** is the swollen base that contains **ovules**. The ovules house the female gamete (egg cell), and after fertilization, they develop into seeds.

11. **Explain how the structure of wind-pollinated flowers is adapted to their mode of pollination, giving specific examples.**
    Wind-pollinated flowers are highly specialized for inefficient, random pollen dispersal by wind.
    *   **Inconspicuous Flowers:** They are typically small, dull-colored (often green or brown), and lack petals, scent, and nectar because they do not need to attract animal pollinators. Example: **Grasses**.
    *   **Pollen Production:** They produce pollen in enormous quantities to increase the probability that some will land on a suitable stigma. The pollen grains are very small, light, and dry, allowing them to be carried long distances by the wind. Example: **Pine** trees releasing clouds of yellow pollen.
    *   **Exposed Stamens and Stigmas:** The stamens often have long filaments that hang outside the flower, exposing the anthers to the wind. The stigmas are large, feathery, and branched to create a large surface area for trapping airborne pollen. Example: **Maize** with its long, silky stigmas (silks).

12. **Describe the journey from pollination to seed formation, explaining each step in detail.**
    The journey involves several key stages:
    1.  **Pollination:** Pollen from an anther is transferred to a compatible stigma by an agent like wind or insects.
    2.  **Pollen Germination:** The pollen grain forms a pollen tube that grows down through the style towards the ovary.
    3.  **Fertilization:** The pollen tube reaches an ovule, and a male gamete fuses with the female egg cell to form a zygote.
    4.  **Embryo Development:** The zygote divides and develops into an embryo, which consists of a radicle, plumule, and cotyledons.
    5.  **Seed Development:** The entire ovule matures into a **seed**. The outer layers of the ovule harden to become the protective **seed coat**, and nutritive tissue (like endosperm) develops.
    6.  **Fruit Development:** Simultaneously, the ovary containing the ovules matures into a **fruit**, which encloses and protects the newly formed seeds.

13. **Compare monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous seeds in terms of structure, germination, and examples.**
    *   **Structure:** The most fundamental difference is the number of cotyledons. **Monocot** seeds have one cotyledon (e.g., **Maize**, **Rice**), while **Dicot** seeds have two (e.g., **Bean**, **Gram**). In monocots, food is stored in the endosperm, whereas in dicots, it is typically stored in the fleshy cotyledons themselves.
    *   **Germination:** Monocots usually exhibit **hypogeal germination**, where the cotyledon remains underground, and the plumule is protected by a sheath as it emerges. Dicots often exhibit **epigeal germination**, where the two cotyledons are pushed above ground by the growing hypocotyl and may even photosynthesize for a short time.
    *   **Embryo:** The basic structure of the embryo (radicle and plumule) is similar, but in monocots, it is often located to one side of the endosperm.

14. **Explain the importance of different environmental conditions for seed germination and describe what happens if any condition is absent.**
    The three critical conditions for germination are water, warmth, and oxygen.
    *   **Water (Moisture):** Its presence is crucial for rehydrating the dry seed tissues, which activates enzymes and softens the seed coat for the radicle to emerge. **If absent**, the seed remains dormant as metabolic activity cannot begin.
    *   **Warmth (Suitable Temperature):** Temperature controls the rate of enzyme activity and metabolic reactions. Each seed has an optimal range. **If it is too cold or too hot**, enzymes will not function properly, and germination will fail or be severely stunted.
    *   **Oxygen (Air):** Oxygen is essential for aerobic respiration, the process that breaks down stored food to release the large amount of energy required for the embryo's growth. **If absent** (e.g., in waterlogged soil), the seed cannot produce enough energy and will fail to germinate or die.

15. **Describe the structure of different types of fruits and explain how each type helps in seed protection and dispersal.**
    Fruit structure is closely related to its function in seed protection and dispersal.
    *   **Fleshy Fruits (e.g., Mango, Tomato):** These have a soft, juicy pericarp that is attractive to animals. Animals eat the fruit, and the tough seeds pass through their digestive tract unharmed, being dispersed far from the parent plant. The hard endocarp in fruits like mangoes provides extra protection to the seed.
    *   **Dry Dehiscent Fruits (e.g., Pea pod):** These have a dry pericarp that splits open when mature, often forcefully scattering the seeds away from the plant. This mechanism avoids overcrowding.
    *   **Dry Indehiscent Fruits (e.g., Sunflower, Wheat):** These dry fruits do not split open. They rely on other methods for dispersal. For example, a sunflower seed (which is actually a fruit) is often eaten by birds, while wheat grains are dispersed by humans. Some dry fruits have wings or plumes to be carried by the wind.

16. **Explain the process of cross-pollination by insects, describing the adaptations of both flowers and insects.**
    Cross-pollination by insects (entomophily) is a co-evolved relationship.
    *   **Flower Adaptations:** Flowers attract insects using various signals. **Visual cues** include large, brightly colored petals (e.g., yellow, blue, which insects see well). **Olfactory cues** include sweet fragrances. As a **reward**, flowers provide nectar, a sugary liquid. The flower's structure is often shaped to ensure the insect makes contact with the anthers and stigma. The pollen is sticky or spiny, and the stigma is sticky to facilitate pollen transfer.
    *   **Insect Adaptations:** Insects like bees have body parts (e.g., hairy legs) that are well-suited for picking up pollen. They have good vision and a strong sense of smell to locate flowers. They visit flowers to collect nectar for food, and in the process, they unintentionally transfer pollen from one flower to another, thus acting as couriers for the plant's reproduction.

17. **Describe the formation and structure of the embryo, explaining the development from zygote to mature embryo.**
    The formation of the embryo begins immediately after fertilization. The **zygote**, which is a single diploid cell, undergoes a series of mitotic cell divisions to grow into a multicellular structure. This process is called embryogenesis.
    Initially, the zygote divides to form a small group of cells. As development continues, these cells differentiate to form the basic structures of the mature **embryo**. The mature embryo is essentially a miniature plant, consisting of:
    *   An **embryonic axis**, which has two ends.
    *   The **radicle**, or embryonic root, which is at one end of the axis and is the first part to emerge during germination to form the root system.
    *   The **plumule**, or embryonic shoot, which is at the other end and will develop into the stem and leaves.
    *   One or two **cotyledons** (seed leaves), which are attached to the embryonic axis and serve as a food source.

18. **Explain the advantages and disadvantages of self-pollination and cross-pollination with suitable examples.**
    *   **Self-Pollination (e.g., Pea plants):**
        *   **Advantages:** It is a reliable and efficient method of reproduction as it does not depend on external agents. It preserves desirable parental traits, which is useful in agriculture. Less pollen needs to be produced.
        *   **Disadvantages:** It leads to a lack of genetic variation, making the population more vulnerable to diseases and environmental changes. Continuous self-pollination can lead to a loss of vigor and vitality over generations.
    *   **Cross-Pollination (e.g., Roses, Sunflowers):**
        *   **Advantages:** The primary advantage is the creation of **genetic diversity** in offspring, which increases the species' ability to adapt to changing conditions and can lead to healthier, more vigorous plants.
        *   **Disadvantages:** It is less certain as it depends on external agents like wind or insects, which may not be available. The plant must expend more energy producing large amounts of pollen and attractive features like large petals and nectar.

19. **Describe the complete life cycle of a flowering plant from pollination to germination of the next generation.**
    The life cycle of a flowering plant is a continuous loop of reproduction and growth.
    1.  **Pollination:** The cycle begins with the transfer of pollen from an anther to a stigma.
    2.  **Fertilization:** A male gamete from the pollen grain fuses with the female gamete in an ovule, forming a zygote.
    3.  **Fruit and Seed Development:** The zygote develops into an embryo, the ovule becomes a seed, and the ovary ripens into a fruit that encloses the seed(s).
    4.  **Seed Dispersal:** The mature fruit facilitates the dispersal of seeds away from the parent plant, carried by wind, water, or animals.
    5.  **Dormancy:** The seed may remain dormant until conditions are favorable.
    6.  **Germination:** When conditions (water, warmth, oxygen) are right, the seed germinates. The radicle emerges to form the root, and the plumule grows to form the shoot.
    7.  **Growth and Maturation:** The seedling grows into a mature plant, developing roots, a stem, leaves, and eventually, its own flowers, at which point the cycle can begin again.

20. **Explain the structural adaptations of water-pollinated flowers and compare them with wind and insect-pollinated flowers.**
    **Water-pollinated (Hydrophilous) Flowers:**
    *   **Structure:** These flowers are generally small, inconspicuous, and lack bright colors, scent, or nectar. Their key adaptation is related to the pollen. The pollen grains are often light and have a waterproof, unwettable coating that prevents them from getting waterlogged, allowing them to float. In some species like *Vallisneria*, the male flowers detach and float to the female flowers.
    **Comparison:**
    *   **vs. Wind-pollinated:** Both are pollinated by abiotic agents and thus lack features to attract animals. However, wind-pollinated flowers produce vast amounts of dry, dust-like pollen, while water-pollinated flowers produce unwettable pollen, often in smaller quantities.
    *   **vs. Insect-pollinated:** They are opposites in almost every way. Insect-pollinated flowers are large, showy, and produce nectar and sticky pollen to interact with animals. Water-pollinated flowers are stripped of all these features as they are unnecessary and would be a waste of energy.

21. **Describe the process of fruit development from flower, explaining the fate of each floral part.**
    Fruit development is initiated by hormones released after successful fertilization.
    *   **Ovary:** This is the primary part that develops into the fruit. The wall of the ovary thickens and matures into the **pericarp**. The ovary grows significantly in size as food reserves are mobilized to it.
    *   **Ovules:** The ovules inside the ovary develop into the **seeds**.
    *   **Fate of Other Parts:**
        *   **Stigma and Style:** Having served their function of receiving pollen and guiding the pollen tube, they wither and fall off.
        *   **Petals:** Their role in attracting pollinators is over, so they wither and drop.
        *   **Stamens:** Their pollen has been shed, so they also wither and fall away.
        *   **Sepals:** In most plants, the sepals also wither and fall off. However, in some cases (like in a tomato or brinjal), they may persist and remain attached to the base of the fruit.
    Essentially, the flower transforms from a reproductive structure into a vessel for protecting and dispersing the next generation (the seeds).

22. **Explain the role of environmental factors in pollination and describe how different pollinators are attracted to flowers.**
    Environmental factors play a key role in pollination success. **Wind** speed and direction are critical for anemophily. **Rain** can wash away pollen and deter flying insects, hindering both wind and insect pollination. **Temperature** affects the activity of insect pollinators, as most are less active in cold weather.
    Different pollinators are attracted by specific floral signals:
    *   **Bees** are attracted to bright blue and yellow flowers, often with sweet scents and nectar guides (patterns visible in UV light).
    *   **Birds**, like hummingbirds, are attracted to red, orange, or white tubular flowers that produce large amounts of thin nectar. They have poor sense of smell, so these flowers are often odorless.
    *   **Moths and Bats** are active at night, so they are attracted to large, white or pale-colored flowers that are heavily fragrant and open in the evening or at night.

23. **Describe the internal structure of a seed and explain how each part contributes to the development of a new plant.**
    A seed is a self-contained unit for plant reproduction. Its internal structure consists of:
    1.  **Embryo:** This is the core component, the miniature plant itself.
        *   **Radicle:** The embryonic root. During germination, it is the first part to emerge, growing downwards to anchor the seedling and absorb water and nutrients from the soil.
        *   **Plumule:** The embryonic shoot. It grows upwards, developing into the stem and leaves, which will eventually perform photosynthesis.
        *   **Cotyledon(s):** The seed leaves. Their critical role is to provide the initial energy for germination by storing food (as in dicots like beans) or by transferring food from the endosperm to the embryo (as in monocots like maize).
    2.  **Stored Food:** This nutritive tissue (either in the cotyledons or as endosperm) fuels the embryo's growth until the seedling can produce its own food.
    3.  **Seed Coat:** This tough outer layer protects the delicate embryo and its food supply from physical damage, pests, and drying out.

24. **Explain the significance of sexual reproduction in flowering plants and describe the mechanisms that ensure genetic diversity.**
    The primary significance of sexual reproduction is the creation of **genetic variation** in offspring. This is vital for the adaptation and long-term survival of a species, allowing it to cope with changing environments, diseases, and pests. A genetically diverse population is more resilient than a uniform one.
    Flowering plants have several mechanisms to ensure genetic diversity, primarily by promoting **cross-pollination**:
    *   **Bisexual Flowers with Differential Maturation:** In some flowers, the male and female parts mature at different times, preventing self-pollination.
    *   **Structural Barriers:** The physical arrangement of the stigma and anthers in some flowers makes self-pollination difficult or impossible.
    *   **Self-Incompatibility:** Many plants have a genetic mechanism that allows them to recognize and reject their own pollen, preventing fertilization from occurring after self-pollination.
    *   **Production of Unisexual Flowers:** Some plants produce separate male and female flowers, either on the same plant or on different plants, which necessitates cross-pollination.

25. **Describe the different methods of seed dispersal and explain how fruit structure is related to the method of dispersal.**
    Seed dispersal is the movement of seeds away from the parent plant, which is crucial to reduce competition. The structure of the fruit is highly adapted for its dispersal method.
    *   **Wind Dispersal (Anemochory):** Fruits are typically lightweight and have structures to catch the wind. Examples include the "wings" on maple fruits or the feathery plumes on dandelion fruits (which are achenes).
    *   **Animal Dispersal (Zoochory):**
        *   **Via Ingestion:** Fleshy, sweet, and brightly colored fruits (e.g., berries, mangoes) are eaten by animals. The seeds are tough enough to survive digestion and are deposited in the animal's droppings elsewhere.
        *   **Via Attachment:** Some fruits have hooks, barbs, or spines (e.g., burrs) that attach to the fur of passing animals and are carried away.
    *   **Water Dispersal (Hydrochory):** Fruits of aquatic or coastal plants (e.g., coconut) are buoyant and have a waterproof pericarp, allowing them to float for long periods to new locations.
    *   **Mechanical (Self) Dispersal:** Some dry fruits (e.g., pea pods) are structured to dry out and twist, splitting open explosively to fling the seeds away from the parent.
