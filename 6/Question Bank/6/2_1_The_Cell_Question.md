## SECTION D: LONG ANSWER QUESTIONS (3 MARKS EACH)

1.  Plant and animal cells both have a nucleus, cytoplasm, and cell membrane. However, plant cells have a cell wall, chloroplasts, and a large central vacuole, which are absent in animal cells. These differences result in plant cells having a fixed shape and the ability to perform photosynthesis, while animal cells are more flexible and obtain energy from external sources.
2.  A plant cell has a rigid cell wall made of cellulose, a cell membrane, a nucleus containing genetic material, cytoplasm where metabolic reactions occur, chloroplasts for photosynthesis, and a large central vacuole for storage and support. The nucleus controls all cellular activities, and the cell membrane regulates the passage of substances.
3.  The cell membrane maintains cellular homeostasis by controlling the movement of substances into and out of the cell through its selective permeability. It also facilitates cellular processes by providing a site for cell communication and transport of molecules via embedded proteins.
4.  Plastids are important organelles in plant cells. Chloroplasts are the site of photosynthesis, converting light energy to chemical energy. Chromoplasts synthesize and store pigments, giving color to flowers and fruits. Leucoplasts are involved in the storage of starch, oils, and proteins.
5.  The nucleus is the control center of the cell, containing the genetic material (DNA) organized into chromosomes. It is enclosed by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope. The nucleus controls all cellular activities, including growth, metabolism, and reproduction, by regulating gene expression.
6.  Plant cells have a large, permanent central vacuole that stores water, nutrients, and waste products, and maintains turgor pressure. Animal cells have small, temporary vacuoles that are involved in temporary storage and transport. The large vacuole in plant cells is crucial for structural support.
7.  Cytoplasm is the jelly-like substance that fills the cell and is composed of cytosol (the fluid portion) and organelles. It is the site of many metabolic reactions, such as glycolysis. The cytoplasm provides a medium for the movement of organelles and substances within the cell, facilitating cellular metabolism.
8.  The cell wall in plants is a key evolutionary adaptation that provides structural support, allowing plants to grow upright. It also protects the cell from mechanical stress and pathogens. The rigidity of the cell wall prevents the cell from bursting due to excessive water uptake.
9.  Photosynthesis is the process by which plant cells convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts, which contain chlorophyll to absorb light. The chemical energy stored in glucose is then used to fuel the plant's metabolic activities.
10. The selective permeability of the cell membrane is crucial for cellular transport processes. It allows the cell to take in necessary nutrients and expel waste products while preventing harmful substances from entering. This regulation is essential for maintaining the cell's internal environment and overall function.
11. The nucleus is a large, double-membraned organelle that contains the cell's genetic material in the form of chromosomes. It controls cellular activities by regulating which genes are expressed and when, thereby directing the synthesis of proteins and controlling all aspects of cell function.
12. Turgor pressure is the pressure exerted by the fluid in a plant cell that pushes the cell membrane against the cell wall. This pressure is essential for maintaining the rigidity of plant cells and providing structural support to the plant as a whole, allowing it to stand upright.
13. Plant cells are generally larger and more rigid than animal cells due to the presence of a rigid cell wall and a large central vacuole. The cell wall provides a fixed shape and structural support, while the large vacuole maintains turgor pressure, contributing to the cell's rigidity.
14. The different types of plastids are chloroplasts, chromoplasts, and leucoplasts. They are all thought to have evolved from a common proplastid. Chloroplasts are specialized for photosynthesis, chromoplasts for pigment synthesis, and leucoplasts for storage, showing a clear division of labor.
15. The large central vacuole in plant cells has several functional significances. It serves as a storage reservoir for water, nutrients, and waste products. It also plays a crucial role in maintaining turgor pressure, which is essential for the structural support and rigidity of the plant cell.
16. In plant cells, organelles work together in a coordinated manner. The nucleus controls all activities, chloroplasts produce energy through photosynthesis, the vacuole provides storage and support, and the cell membrane regulates transport. This cellular organization ensures the efficient functioning of the cell.
17. The cell wall in plants provides defense against pathogens by acting as a physical barrier. It also offers structural support, allowing plants to grow tall and withstand environmental stresses such as wind and gravity. This support is crucial for the overall architecture of the plant.
18. The cell membrane is described by the fluid mosaic model, which states that it is a fluid structure with a "mosaic" of various proteins embedded in a lipid bilayer. This structure allows the membrane to be flexible and dynamic, with proteins able to move laterally, which is important for its function.
19. The absence of a cell wall in animal cells makes them more flexible, allowing for a greater variety of cell shapes and movements. However, it also means that they lack the structural support and protection that a cell wall provides, making them more susceptible to bursting if they take in too much water.
20. The cytoplasm plays a crucial role in cellular transport by providing a medium for the movement of molecules and organelles. It also helps in organizing the organelles within the cell, ensuring that they are in the correct position to carry out their functions efficiently.
21. The nucleus and cytoplasm have a close functional relationship. The nucleus contains the genetic information and controls the synthesis of proteins, which then carry out their functions in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm, in turn, is where many of the metabolic reactions that support the nucleus and the rest of the cell occur.
22. Membrane-bound organelles in eukaryotic cells, such as the nucleus, chloroplasts, and vacuoles, allow for the compartmentalization of cellular functions. This separation of tasks increases the efficiency of cellular processes by creating specialized environments for different reactions to occur.
23. Plant cells achieve structural support through a combination of the rigid cell wall and turgor pressure. The cell wall provides a strong outer framework, while the turgor pressure exerted by the large central vacuole pushes against the cell wall, creating a rigid and supportive structure.
24. The presence of plastids in plant cells provides a significant evolutionary advantage. Chloroplasts allow plants to produce their own food through photosynthesis, making them autotrophs. Other plastids, such as chromoplasts and leucoplasts, provide additional functions like attracting pollinators and storing food reserves.
25. The organelles in a plant cell function in an integrated manner to maintain viability. The nucleus directs all activities, chloroplasts provide energy, the vacuole maintains turgor and storage, the cell wall provides support and protection, and the cell membrane controls transport. This coordination ensures the survival and proper functioning of the cell.
