## Section C: Short Answer Questions (2 marks each)

1.  **Respiration vs. Breathing:** Breathing is a physical process of inhaling and exhaling air, involving the lungs and muscles. Respiration is a biochemical process occurring inside cells (mitochondria) to release energy from food, involving enzymes.
2.  **Mechanism of Inhalation:** During inhalation, the diaphragm contracts and moves down, while the intercostal muscles contract, pulling the ribs up and out. This increases the volume of the thoracic cavity, which lowers the pressure inside the lungs, causing air to rush in.
3.  **Mechanism of Exhalation:** Exhalation is typically a passive process. The diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax, causing the ribs to move down and in and the diaphragm to move up. This decreases the thoracic cavity volume, increasing lung pressure and forcing air out.
4.  **Main Respiratory Parts & Functions:**
    *   **Nose:** Filters, warms, and moistens air.
    *   **Pharynx:** Passageway for air and food.
    *   **Larynx:** Produces sound (voice).
    *   **Trachea:** Carries air to the bronchi.
    *   **Lungs:** Site of gas exchange.
5.  **Location & Enzymes (Respiration vs. Breathing):** Breathing occurs in the lungs and respiratory passages and involves no enzymes. Cellular respiration occurs inside the mitochondria of all body cells and requires numerous enzymes to proceed.
6.  **Asthma Symptoms:** Asthma causes **wheezing**, a whistling sound from narrowed airways; **coughing**, an attempt to clear the airways; and **chest tightness**, a feeling of pressure. These occur because inflammation and muscle constriction narrow the airways, making it hard to breathe.
7.  **Bronchitis:** Bronchitis is the inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes. It is often caused by viral or bacterial infections. Its main symptom is a persistent cough that produces mucus.
8.  **Pneumonia:** Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus, which interferes with gas exchange. Common symptoms include cough, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing.
9.  **Tuberculosis (TB):** TB is a serious infectious disease caused by the bacterium *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. It primarily affects the lungs but can spread to other parts of the body. It is transmitted through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
10. **Air Pathway:** Air enters through the **Nose/Mouth** → **Pharynx** → **Larynx** → **Trachea** → **Bronchi** → **Bronchioles** → **Alveoli** in the lungs.
11. **Tracheal Rings:** The C-shaped cartilaginous rings provide support to the trachea, preventing it from collapsing and ensuring the airway remains open. They are C-shaped to allow the esophagus, which runs behind the trachea, to expand when swallowing food.
12. **Alveoli Structure & Function:** Alveoli are tiny, thin-walled air sacs clustered at the end of bronchioles. Their thin walls, large surface area, and rich blood supply from surrounding capillaries make them perfectly suited for the efficient exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and the blood.
13. **Pharynx Function:** The pharynx, or throat, serves as a common passageway for both air traveling to the larynx and food traveling to the esophagus. It connects the nasal and oral cavities to the larynx and esophagus, directing traffic for both the respiratory and digestive systems.
14. **Larynx Description:** The larynx, or voice box, is located in the neck between the pharynx and the trachea. Its two main functions are to produce sound via the vibration of the vocal cords and to prevent food from entering the trachea during swallowing via the epiglottis.
15. **Chest Volume & Lung Pressure:** During breathing, there is an inverse relationship between chest cavity volume and lung pressure. When the chest volume increases (inhalation), the pressure inside the lungs decreases, drawing air in. When the chest volume decreases (exhalation), the pressure inside the lungs increases, forcing air out.
16. **Energy in Respiration vs. Breathing:** Breathing is a mechanical process that consumes a small amount of energy to power muscle contractions. Respiration is a biochemical process that *releases* a large amount of energy from the chemical bonds in food molecules (like glucose) for the body to use.
17. **Intercostal Muscles Role:** The intercostal muscles, located between the ribs, play a key role in breathing. The external intercostals contract to lift the rib cage up and out during inhalation, increasing chest volume. The internal intercostals can contract during forced exhalation to pull the rib cage down and in.
18. **Nose Importance:** The nose is important because it **filters** out dust and particles with its hairs and mucus, **warms** the inhaled air to body temperature, and **moistens** the air to prevent the delicate lung tissue from drying out.
19. **Bronchi and Bronchioles:** The trachea divides into two main bronchi, one for each lung. Inside the lungs, these bronchi branch repeatedly into smaller and smaller tubes called bronchioles. Both structures serve as conduits to carry air deeper into the lungs, terminating at the alveoli.
20. **Chronic vs. Acute Respiratory Conditions:** Acute conditions, like the common cold or acute bronchitis, are sudden and short-term. Chronic conditions, like asthma or COPD, are long-lasting and often progressive, requiring ongoing management.
21. **Gas Exchange:** Gas exchange occurs in the alveoli of the lungs. Oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses across the thin walls of the alveoli and into the surrounding capillaries to enter the bloodstream. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide, a waste product from the body, diffuses from the blood into the alveoli to be exhaled.
22. **Respiratory & Circulatory System Importance:** These two systems are critically linked. The respiratory system is responsible for taking in oxygen and removing carbon dioxide from the body. The circulatory system is responsible for transporting these gases between the lungs and the body's cells. Without one, the other cannot function to sustain life.
23. **Respiratory Protective Mechanisms:** The respiratory system is protected by: 1) **Nasal hairs and mucus** that trap particles. 2) **Cilia** in the trachea and bronchi that sweep mucus and debris upward to be coughed out. 3) **Coughing and sneezing reflexes** that forcefully expel irritants.
24. **Breathing During Exercise:** During exercise, the breathing rate and depth increase significantly. This happens because the working muscles produce more carbon dioxide and consume more oxygen. The brain detects these changes in the blood and signals the respiratory muscles to work harder to supply the needed oxygen and remove the excess CO2.
25. **Consequences of Respiratory Diseases:** Respiratory diseases disrupt normal breathing by various mechanisms. For example, asthma narrows the airways, making it difficult to move air. Pneumonia fills the alveoli with fluid, impairing gas exchange. These disruptions lead to symptoms like shortness of breath, low blood oxygen levels, and reduced physical capacity.

## Section D: Long Answer Questions (3 marks each)

1.  **Respiratory System Diagram & Functions:** (A diagram would be drawn here). 
    *   **Nose:** Filters, warms, and moistens incoming air. 
    *   **Pharynx:** A shared passage for air and food. 
    *   **Larynx:** The voice box, contains vocal cords for sound production. 
    *   **Trachea:** The windpipe, a tube reinforced with cartilage that carries air to the lungs. 
    *   **Bronchi:** Two main branches off the trachea, leading into each lung. 
    *   **Lungs:** The primary organs where gas exchange occurs. 
    *   **Diaphragm:** A large muscle beneath the lungs that drives the act of breathing.

2.  **Complete Mechanism of Breathing:** Breathing involves two phases. **Inhalation** is an active process where the diaphragm contracts and flattens, and the external intercostal muscles contract, lifting the rib cage up and out. This combined action increases the volume of the thoracic cavity, causing the pressure within the lungs to drop below atmospheric pressure, and air rushes in. **Exhalation** is usually passive. The diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax, the chest cavity recoils to its smaller resting size, which increases the pressure in the lungs above atmospheric pressure, forcing air out.

3.  **Respiration vs. Breathing Comparison:** 
    *   **Process Type:** Breathing is a physical, mechanical process of moving air. Respiration is a biochemical, cellular process.
    *   **Location:** Breathing occurs in the lungs and respiratory passages. Respiration occurs in the mitochondria of every cell in the body.
    *   **Energy:** Breathing consumes a small amount of energy. Respiration releases a large amount of energy from food.
    *   **Enzymes:** Breathing involves no enzymes. Respiration is a complex process that relies on numerous specific enzymes.

4.  **Four Major Respiratory Diseases:**
    *   **Asthma:** A chronic inflammatory disease causing airway narrowing. Symptoms include wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness. It is often triggered by allergens or irritants.
    *   **Bronchitis:** Inflammation of the bronchial tubes, leading to a persistent cough with mucus. It can be acute (often viral) or chronic (often from smoking).
    *   **Pneumonia:** An infection of the alveoli, which fill with fluid or pus, impairing gas exchange. Caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi, with symptoms like fever, chills, and cough.
    *   **Tuberculosis (TB):** A serious infectious bacterial disease primarily affecting the lungs. It is caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* and can be fatal if not treated.

5.  **Pathway of Air:** Air enters the **nose**, where it is filtered, warmed, and humidified. It then passes through the **pharynx** and into the **larynx**. From the larynx, it travels down the **trachea**, which is kept open by cartilage rings. The trachea splits into two **bronchi**, which enter the lungs and branch into smaller **bronchioles**. Finally, the air reaches the **alveoli**, tiny air sacs where the critical exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide with the blood occurs.

6.  **Importance of the Diaphragm:** The diaphragm is the primary muscle of respiration. It is a large, dome-shaped sheet of muscle located at the base of the thoracic cavity. It is innervated by the phrenic nerve. During inhalation, it contracts and flattens, dramatically increasing the vertical dimension of the chest cavity. This action is responsible for about 75% of the air movement in normal, quiet breathing. Its relaxation during exhalation allows the chest cavity to shrink, pushing air out.

7.  **Role of Pressure Differences in Breathing:** Breathing operates on the principle of Boyle's Law, where pressure and volume are inversely related. During inhalation, the contraction of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles increases the lung volume, which decreases the intrapulmonary pressure to below atmospheric pressure, causing air to flow in. During exhalation, the relaxation of these muscles decreases lung volume, increasing the intrapulmonary pressure above atmospheric pressure, causing air to flow out. Any condition that prevents these volume changes, like a punctured lung, disrupts this pressure gradient and can cause breathing to fail.

8.  **Protective Mechanisms of the Respiratory System:** The system has several lines of defense. The **nose** acts as a first-line filter with its hairs and mucus. The entire respiratory tract, from the trachea to the bronchi, is lined with a **mucociliary escalator**, where cilia continuously beat upward, moving mucus-trapped debris out of the lungs. Finally, powerful reflex actions like **coughing** and **sneezing** forcefully expel larger irritants from the pharynx, larynx, or trachea.

9.  **Respiratory and Circulatory System Relationship:** These two systems are inextricably linked in a process of gas transport. The respiratory system acquires oxygen from the atmosphere and removes carbon dioxide from the body. The circulatory system, via the blood and heart, acts as the transport medium. Blood picks up oxygen in the lungs, delivers it to the body's tissues for cellular respiration, and picks up the waste product, carbon dioxide, to be transported back to the lungs for exhalation. A failure in one system (e.g., a heart attack or lung disease) will critically impair the function of the other.

10. **Alveoli Structure and Function:** Alveoli are the functional units of the lungs. They are microscopic, grape-like clusters of air sacs with incredibly thin walls (one cell thick) to facilitate rapid gas diffusion. Their effectiveness is enhanced by a massive total surface area (equivalent to a tennis court) and a dense network of surrounding capillaries, ensuring a minimal distance for gases to travel between air and blood. A substance called surfactant prevents the alveoli from collapsing during exhalation.

11. **Asthma Explained:** Asthma is a chronic condition where the airways become inflamed, swollen, and hypersensitive. When exposed to triggers (like pollen, dust, or cold air), the smooth muscles around the airways constrict (bronchospasm), and excess mucus is produced. This combination severely narrows the airways, making it difficult for air to move in and out, leading to the characteristic symptoms of wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness.

12. **Tuberculosis Explained:** Tuberculosis is a contagious and potentially fatal infectious disease caused by the bacterium *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. It is transmitted through airborne droplets from the coughs or sneezes of an infected person. While it primarily attacks the lungs, causing a chronic cough, fever, and weight loss, it can spread to other parts of the body. It is considered serious because the bacteria can remain dormant for years and become active later, and drug-resistant strains are a growing concern.

13. **Pneumonia Analysis:** Pneumonia is an inflammation of the lung tissue, specifically the alveoli, usually caused by infection. The infection leads to the air sacs filling with fluid or pus, which severely interferes with the ability of oxygen to diffuse into the bloodstream. This results in hypoxemia (low blood oxygen). Symptoms reflect this struggle, including high fever, chills, a productive cough, and significant difficulty breathing.

14. **Lung Volumes and Capacities:**
    *   **Tidal Volume (TV):** The amount of air moved in or out during a normal, quiet breath.
    *   **Vital Capacity (VC):** The maximum amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled after taking the deepest possible breath. It represents the total usable volume of the lungs.
    *   **Residual Volume (RV):** The amount of air that remains in the lungs even after a maximal exhalation. This volume ensures that the alveoli do not collapse completely.

15. **Neural Control of Breathing:** Breathing is controlled by the respiratory centers in the **medulla oblongata** and **pons** of the brainstem. The medulla sets the basic rhythm of breathing. These centers receive input from chemoreceptors that monitor the levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and pH in the blood. High CO2 levels are the primary stimulus for increasing the rate and depth of breathing. While the basic rhythm is involuntary, it can be temporarily overridden by conscious control from the cerebral cortex.

16. **Environmental Factors on Respiratory Health:** 
    *   **Pollution:** Air pollutants like smoke, dust, and chemical fumes can irritate the airways, trigger asthma, and contribute to chronic diseases like COPD.
    *   **Altitude:** At high altitudes, the lower partial pressure of oxygen makes it harder to get enough oxygen, leading to shortness of breath and altitude sickness.
    *   **Temperature & Humidity:** Cold, dry air can irritate the airways and trigger bronchospasm in sensitive individuals.

17. **Emergency Respiratory Responses:**
    *   **Breath-holding:** This is a voluntary act controlled by the cerebral cortex, but it is limited by the buildup of CO2 in the blood, which eventually forces an involuntary breath.
    *   **Choking:** This occurs when an object blocks the trachea. The Heimlich maneuver is a first-aid technique to forcefully expel the object by creating a strong artificial cough.
    *   **Artificial Respiration:** (e.g., mouth-to-mouth) is used when a person has stopped breathing. It manually forces air into the lungs to provide oxygen until the person can breathe on their own again.

18. **Age-Related Changes in Respiration:** With age, the respiratory system becomes less efficient. The chest wall becomes more rigid, respiratory muscles weaken, and the elastic recoil of the lungs decreases. This leads to a reduction in vital capacity and makes it harder to cough effectively, increasing the risk of respiratory infections like pneumonia.

19. **Respiratory System and pH Balance:** The respiratory system plays a crucial role in maintaining the body's acid-base balance. Carbon dioxide combines with water in the blood to form carbonic acid. By adjusting the rate and depth of breathing, the body can regulate the amount of CO2 in the blood. For example, if the blood becomes too acidic, the breathing rate increases to blow off more CO2, thus reducing the acidity.

20. **Respiratory Adaptations to Exercise:** During exercise, the respiratory system makes immediate adjustments by increasing the rate and depth of breathing to meet the body's heightened demand for oxygen and to remove excess carbon dioxide. With long-term training, the respiratory muscles become stronger and more efficient, vital capacity may increase slightly, and the body becomes better at extracting oxygen from the air.

21. **Smoking Effects on Respiratory System:** Smoking is devastating to the respiratory system. It paralyzes and destroys the cilia, leading to a buildup of mucus (smoker's cough) and increased infections. It irritates the airways, causing chronic bronchitis, and destroys the delicate alveolar walls, leading to emphysema. It is also the leading cause of lung cancer.

22. **Sleep-Related Breathing Disorders:** **Sleep apnea** is a common disorder where a person repeatedly stops and starts breathing during sleep. The most common type, obstructive sleep apnea, occurs when the throat muscles relax and block the airway. These episodes of apnea lead to poor sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and can increase the risk of high blood pressure, heart attack, and stroke.

23. **Respiratory First Aid:** For someone choking, the **Heimlich maneuver** is the standard response. For someone who has stopped breathing, **cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)**, which combines chest compressions with rescue breaths (artificial respiration), is critical to circulate oxygenated blood until emergency medical services arrive.

24. **Occupational Respiratory Diseases:** Many occupations expose workers to substances that can harm the lungs. For example, coal miners can develop **black lung disease** from coal dust. Construction workers exposed to asbestos can develop **asbestosis** and **mesothelioma**. Prevention involves proper ventilation, wearing protective masks, and minimizing exposure to harmful dusts and chemicals.
25. **Future of Respiratory Health:** The future will likely see challenges from emerging respiratory viruses (like new strains of influenza or coronaviruses) and the effects of climate change and pollution. Advances in treatment may include personalized medicine for conditions like asthma and cystic fibrosis, new antiviral drugs, and improved vaccine technologies. Prevention will remain key, focusing on smoking cessation, air quality control, and global surveillance for new pathogens.
