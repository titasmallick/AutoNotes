## Problem 1: Calculating Rate of Reaction

An enzyme catalyzes a reaction that produces 200 micromoles of product in 5 minutes. Calculate the rate of reaction in micromoles per minute.

**Solution:**

Rate of Reaction = (Amount of Product Formed) / Time Taken

Given:
*   Amount of Product Formed = 200 micromoles
*   Time Taken = 5 minutes

Rate of Reaction = 200 micromoles / 5 minutes
Rate of Reaction = 40 micromoles/minute

Therefore, the rate of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction is 40 micromoles per minute.

## Problem 2: Effect of Temperature (Q10 Value - Conceptual)

The rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction doubles for every 10°C rise in temperature within a certain range (Q10 = 2). If a reaction proceeds at a rate of 5 units at 20°C, what would be its approximate rate at 40°C?

**Solution:**

*   At 20°C, Rate = 5 units
*   Increase from 20°C to 30°C (10°C rise): Rate doubles = 5 * 2 = 10 units
*   Increase from 30°C to 40°C (another 10°C rise): Rate doubles again = 10 * 2 = 20 units

Alternatively, using the Q10 formula:
Rate_T2 = Rate_T1 * (Q10)^((T2-T1)/10)

Given:
*   Rate_T1 = 5 units (at T1 = 20°C)
*   Q10 = 2
*   T2 = 40°C

Rate_40°C = 5 * (2)^((40-20)/10)
Rate_40°C = 5 * (2)^(20/10)
Rate_40°C = 5 * (2)^2
Rate_40°C = 5 * 4
Rate_40°C = 20 units

Therefore, the approximate rate of the reaction at 40°C would be 20 units.
