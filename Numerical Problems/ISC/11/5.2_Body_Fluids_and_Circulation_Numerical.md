# Numerical Problems: Cardiac Cycle

**Q1: A person has a heart rate of 75 beats per minute. Calculate the duration of their cardiac cycle.**

**Solution:**
The duration of one cardiac cycle is the reciprocal of the heart rate.
Duration = 60 seconds / Heart Rate
Duration = 60 / 75 = 0.8 seconds.

**Q2: If a cardiac cycle is 0.8 seconds long, and the ventricular systole lasts for 0.3 seconds, what is the duration of ventricular diastole?**

**Solution:**
Total cycle duration = Ventricular Systole + Ventricular Diastole
0.8 s = 0.3 s + Ventricular Diastole
Ventricular Diastole = 0.8 - 0.3 = 0.5 seconds.

**Q3: In a normal cardiac cycle of 0.8s, atrial systole is 0.1s, and ventricular systole is 0.3s. Calculate the duration of joint diastole.**

**Solution:**
Joint diastole is the period when both atria and ventricles are relaxed.
The total duration of the cardiac cycle is 0.8s.
The heart is in some form of systole for 0.1s (atria) + 0.3s (ventricle) = 0.4s.
The rest of the time it is in joint diastole.
Joint Diastole = 0.8s - 0.4s = 0.4s.
