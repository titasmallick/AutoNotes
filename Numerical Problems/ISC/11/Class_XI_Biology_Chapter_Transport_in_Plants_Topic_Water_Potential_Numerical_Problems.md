# Class XI Biology - Chapter: Transport in Plants - Topic: Water Potential Numerical Problems

## Problem 1: Calculating Water Potential

A plant cell has a solute potential (Ψs) of -0.7 MPa and a pressure potential (Ψp) of 0.3 MPa. Calculate the water potential (Ψ) of this cell.

**Solution:**

Water potential (Ψ) is the sum of solute potential (Ψs) and pressure potential (Ψp).

Ψ = Ψs + Ψp

Given:
*   Ψs = -0.7 MPa
*   Ψp = 0.3 MPa

Ψ = -0.7 MPa + 0.3 MPa
Ψ = -0.4 MPa

Therefore, the water potential of this cell is -0.4 MPa.

## Problem 2: Water Movement Based on Water Potential

Cell A has a water potential of -0.5 MPa, and Cell B has a water potential of -0.8 MPa. In which direction will there be a net movement of water between these two cells?

**Solution:**

Water always moves from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential.

*   Cell A Water Potential (ΨA) = -0.5 MPa
*   Cell B Water Potential (ΨB) = -0.8 MPa

Comparing the two values, -0.5 MPa is higher (less negative) than -0.8 MPa.

Therefore, there will be a net movement of water from Cell A to Cell B.
