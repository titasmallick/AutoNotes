## Problem 1: Arithmetic Growth Rate

A plant stem initially measures 5 cm in length. After 10 days, its length increases to 15 cm. Assuming arithmetic growth, calculate the growth rate per day.

**Solution:**

Arithmetic growth is characterized by a constant increase in length over time. The formula for arithmetic growth rate is:

Growth Rate = (Final Length - Initial Length) / Time

Given:
*   Initial Length (L0) = 5 cm
*   Final Length (Lt) = 15 cm
*   Time (t) = 10 days

Growth Rate = (15 cm - 5 cm) / 10 days
Growth Rate = 10 cm / 10 days
Growth Rate = 1 cm/day

Therefore, the plant stem's arithmetic growth rate is 1 cm per day.

## Problem 2: Relative Growth Rate (Conceptual)

Plant A increases its leaf area from 10 cm² to 20 cm² in a week. Plant B increases its leaf area from 100 cm² to 110 cm² in the same week. Which plant shows a higher relative growth rate?

**Solution:**

Relative growth rate (RGR) is the growth per unit of initial size over a given period. It is a more accurate measure for comparing growth in organisms of different initial sizes.

*   **Plant A:**
    Increase in area = 20 cm² - 10 cm² = 10 cm²
    Relative growth rate = (Increase in area / Initial area) = 10 cm² / 10 cm² = 1 (or 100% increase)

*   **Plant B:**
    Increase in area = 110 cm² - 100 cm² = 10 cm²
    Relative growth rate = (Increase in area / Initial area) = 10 cm² / 100 cm² = 0.1 (or 10% increase)

Although both plants increased their leaf area by the same absolute amount (10 cm²), Plant A shows a higher relative growth rate because its growth is a larger proportion of its initial size.

Therefore, Plant A shows a higher relative growth rate.
