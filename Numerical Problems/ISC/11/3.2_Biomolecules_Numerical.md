# Numerical Problems: Enzyme Kinetics

**Q1: An enzyme has a Vmax of 100 µM/s and a Km of 2mM. What is the velocity of the reaction when the substrate concentration is 2mM?**

**Solution:**
According to the Michaelis-Menten equation: v = (Vmax * [S]) / (Km + [S])
Given: Vmax = 100 µM/s, Km = 2mM, [S] = 2mM.
v = (100 * 2) / (2 + 2) = 200 / 4 = 50 µM/s.
This is consistent with the definition of Km as the substrate concentration at which the reaction velocity is half of Vmax.

**Q2: The Vmax for an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is 60 µM/min. The Km is 1 mM. What is the substrate concentration when the velocity is 20 µM/min?**

**Solution:**
Using the Michaelis-Menten equation: v = (Vmax * [S]) / (Km + [S])
20 = (60 * [S]) / (1 + [S])
20 * (1 + [S]) = 60 * [S]
20 + 20[S] = 60[S]
20 = 40[S]
[S] = 20 / 40 = 0.5 mM.

**Q3: A Lineweaver-Burk plot gives a y-intercept of 0.05 (µM/min)⁻¹ and an x-intercept of -0.2 (mM)⁻¹. Calculate Vmax and Km.**

**Solution:**
The y-intercept = 1/Vmax.
0.05 = 1/Vmax
Vmax = 1 / 0.05 = 20 µM/min.
The x-intercept = -1/Km.
-0.2 = -1/Km
Km = 1 / 0.2 = 5 mM.

**Q4: An enzyme has a Km of 5x10⁻⁵ M. A competitive inhibitor is present at a concentration of 2x10⁻⁵ M, and the inhibitor constant Ki is 4x10⁻⁵ M. Calculate the apparent Km (Km_app).**

**Solution:**
For competitive inhibition, the apparent Km is calculated as: Km_app = Km * (1 + [I]/Ki)
Km_app = 5x10⁻⁵ * (1 + (2x10⁻⁵ / 4x10⁻⁵))
Km_app = 5x10⁻⁵ * (1 + 0.5)
Km_app = 5x10⁻⁵ * 1.5 = 7.5x10⁻⁵ M.
