## Problem 1: Tidal Volume and Minute Ventilation

A person breathes 16 times per minute, and their tidal volume is 500 mL. Calculate their minute ventilation.

**Solution:**

Minute ventilation is the total volume of air inhaled or exhaled per minute. It is calculated by multiplying the tidal volume by the respiratory rate.

*   **Tidal Volume (TV):** 500 mL = 0.5 L
*   **Respiratory Rate (RR):** 16 breaths/minute

Minute Ventilation = Tidal Volume x Respiratory Rate
Minute Ventilation = 0.5 L/breath * 16 breaths/minute
Minute Ventilation = 8 L/minute

Therefore, the person's minute ventilation is 8 liters per minute.

## Problem 2: Vital Capacity Calculation

Given the following lung volumes for an individual:
*   Tidal Volume (TV) = 500 mL
*   Inspiratory Reserve Volume (IRV) = 3000 mL
*   Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV) = 1000 mL

Calculate the Vital Capacity (VC) of this individual.

**Solution:**

Vital Capacity (VC) is the maximum volume of air a person can breathe out after a forced inspiration. It is the sum of Tidal Volume, Inspiratory Reserve Volume, and Expiratory Reserve Volume.

Vital Capacity (VC) = TV + IRV + ERV
Vital Capacity (VC) = 500 mL + 3000 mL + 1000 mL
Vital Capacity (VC) = 4500 mL

Therefore, the vital capacity of this individual is 4500 mL or 4.5 liters.
