# Class XI Biology - Chapter: Excretory Products and their Elimination - Topic: Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) Numerical Problems

## Problem 1: Calculating GFR from Urine and Plasma Concentrations

In a healthy individual, the concentration of creatinine in plasma is 0.01 mg/mL, and its concentration in urine is 1.2 mg/mL. If the urine flow rate is 1 mL/minute, calculate the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in mL/minute, assuming creatinine is freely filtered and not reabsorbed or secreted.

**Solution:**

The GFR can be calculated using the clearance formula, which for a substance like creatinine (freely filtered, not reabsorbed or secreted) is:

GFR = (Urine Concentration of Substance * Urine Flow Rate) / Plasma Concentration of Substance

Given:
*   Urine Concentration of Creatinine (U_creat) = 1.2 mg/mL
*   Plasma Concentration of Creatinine (P_creat) = 0.01 mg/mL
*   Urine Flow Rate (V) = 1 mL/minute

GFR = (U_creat * V) / P_creat
GFR = (1.2 mg/mL * 1 mL/minute) / 0.01 mg/mL
GFR = 1.2 / 0.01 mL/minute
GFR = 120 mL/minute

Therefore, the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is 120 mL/minute.

## Problem 2: Daily Urine Output (Conceptual)

If a person's GFR is 125 mL/minute, and 99% of the filtrate is reabsorbed, what is the approximate daily urine output in liters?

**Solution:**

First, calculate the total volume of filtrate formed per day:

*   GFR = 125 mL/minute
*   Filtrate per hour = 125 mL/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 7500 mL/hour
*   Filtrate per day = 7500 mL/hour * 24 hours/day = 180,000 mL/day

Now, calculate the volume of urine formed, given that 99% of the filtrate is reabsorbed:

*   Percentage of filtrate excreted as urine = 100% - 99% = 1%
*   Volume of urine = 1% of total filtrate per day
*   Volume of urine = 0.01 * 180,000 mL/day = 1800 mL/day

Convert milliliters to liters:
*   Volume of urine = 1800 mL / 1000 mL/L = 1.8 L/day

Therefore, the approximate daily urine output is 1.8 liters.
