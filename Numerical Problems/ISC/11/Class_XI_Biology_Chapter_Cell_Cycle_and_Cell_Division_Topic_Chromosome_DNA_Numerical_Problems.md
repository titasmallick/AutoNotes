## Problem 1: Chromosome and DNA Content in Mitosis

A diploid somatic cell of an organism has 2n = 46 chromosomes and 2C amount of DNA in G1 phase. What will be the number of chromosomes and the amount of DNA in this cell after S phase and after Telophase of Mitosis?

**Solution:**

*   **G1 Phase:**
    *   Number of chromosomes = 2n = 46
    *   Amount of DNA = 2C

*   **After S Phase (G2 Phase):** DNA replication occurs, but the number of chromosomes (centromeres) remains the same. Each chromosome now consists of two sister chromatids.
    *   Number of chromosomes = 2n = 46
    *   Amount of DNA = 4C (DNA content doubles)

*   **After Telophase of Mitosis (in each daughter cell):** The sister chromatids separate, and the cell divides, resulting in two identical diploid daughter cells.
    *   Number of chromosomes = 2n = 46
    *   Amount of DNA = 2C (returns to original G1 amount)

## Problem 2: Chromosome and DNA Content in Meiosis

Consider a diploid cell with 2n = 4 chromosomes and 2C amount of DNA in G1 phase. What will be the number of chromosomes and the amount of DNA in the cell at the end of Meiosis I and at the end of Meiosis II (in each daughter cell)?

**Solution:**

*   **G1 Phase:**
    *   Number of chromosomes = 2n = 4
    *   Amount of DNA = 2C

*   **After S Phase (before Meiosis I):** DNA replication occurs.
    *   Number of chromosomes = 2n = 4
    *   Amount of DNA = 4C

*   **End of Meiosis I (in each daughter cell):** Homologous chromosomes separate. The cell becomes haploid in terms of chromosome number, but each chromosome still has two chromatids.
    *   Number of chromosomes = n = 2
    *   Amount of DNA = 2C

*   **End of Meiosis II (in each daughter cell):** Sister chromatids separate. The cell remains haploid, and the DNA content is halved.
    *   Number of chromosomes = n = 2
    *   Amount of DNA = C
