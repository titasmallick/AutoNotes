## Problem 1: Cardiac Output Calculation

A person has a stroke volume of 70 mL/beat and a heart rate of 72 beats/minute. Calculate their cardiac output in liters per minute.

**Solution:**

Cardiac Output (CO) is the volume of blood pumped by the heart per minute. It is calculated by multiplying the stroke volume by the heart rate.

*   **Stroke Volume (SV):** 70 mL/beat
*   **Heart Rate (HR):** 72 beats/minute

Cardiac Output = Stroke Volume x Heart Rate
Cardiac Output = 70 mL/beat * 72 beats/minute
Cardiac Output = 5040 mL/minute

To convert milliliters to liters, divide by 1000:
Cardiac Output = 5040 mL/minute / 1000 mL/L = 5.04 L/minute

Therefore, the person's cardiac output is 5.04 liters per minute.

## Problem 2: Blood Pressure Interpretation (Conceptual)

A person's blood pressure reading is 120/80 mmHg. What do these two numbers represent?

**Solution:**

*   **120 mmHg (Systolic Pressure):** This is the higher number and represents the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats (contracts and pumps blood).
*   **80 mmHg (Diastolic Pressure):** This is the lower number and represents the pressure in the arteries when the heart is at rest between beats.

This reading indicates a normal blood pressure.
