# Numerical Problems: Respiration in Plants

**Q1: Calculate the Respiratory Quotient (RQ) for the complete oxidation of Tripalmitin, a fatty acid with the formula C₅₁H₉₈O₆.**

**Solution:**
The balanced equation for the oxidation of Tripalmitin is:
2C₅₁H₉₈O₆ + 145O₂ → 102CO₂ + 98H₂O
RQ = Volume of CO₂ evolved / Volume of O₂ consumed
RQ = 102 / 145 ≈ 0.7

**Q2: If 4 molecules of glucose enter glycolysis, what is the net production of ATP and NADH?**

**Solution:**
For each molecule of glucose, glycolysis produces a net of 2 ATP and 2 NADH.
For 4 molecules of glucose:
Net ATP = 4 * 2 = 8 ATP
Net NADH = 4 * 2 = 8 NADH

**Q3: A plant is respiring using a substrate with the chemical formula C₄H₆O₅. Calculate the RQ.**

**Solution:**
The balanced equation for the oxidation of this organic acid (Malic Acid) is:
C₄H₆O₅ + 3O₂ → 4CO₂ + 3H₂O
RQ = Volume of CO₂ evolved / Volume of O₂ consumed
RQ = 4 / 3 ≈ 1.33

**Q4: In an experiment, 10 molecules of CO₂ are evolved and 10 molecules of O₂ are consumed. What is the RQ and what type of substrate is being used?**

**Solution:**
RQ = Volume of CO₂ evolved / Volume of O₂ consumed
RQ = 10 / 10 = 1
An RQ of 1 indicates that the respiratory substrate is a carbohydrate.
