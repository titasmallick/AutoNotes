## Problem 1: Calculating Number of Restriction Sites

A plasmid DNA is 5000 base pairs (bp) long. A restriction enzyme EcoRI recognizes a 6-base pair recognition sequence. Assuming the bases are randomly distributed and occur with equal frequency, approximately how many EcoRI recognition sites would you expect to find in this plasmid?

**Solution:**

The probability of finding a specific 6-base pair sequence (like EcoRI's GAATTC) is (1/4)^6, since there are 4 possible bases (A, T, C, G) at each position.

Probability = (1/4)^6 = 1/4096

Expected number of sites = (Length of DNA) / (Probability of recognition sequence)
Expected number of sites = 5000 bp / 4096 bp/site â‰ˆ 1.22 sites

Therefore, you would expect to find approximately 1 or 2 EcoRI recognition sites in this plasmid.

## Problem 2: Calculating DNA Concentration after Ligation

You have 100 ng of a plasmid vector (5 kb) and you want to ligate an insert DNA fragment (1 kb) into it. For optimal ligation, a vector:insert molar ratio of 1:3 is desired. How much insert DNA (in ng) should you add to the ligation reaction?

**Solution:**

First, calculate the moles of vector DNA:

Moles of vector = (Mass of vector in ng) / (Molecular weight of vector in ng/mole)
Molecular weight is proportional to size in kb.

Moles of vector (relative) = 100 ng / 5 kb = 20 ng/kb

Now, calculate the desired moles of insert DNA based on the 1:3 molar ratio:

Desired moles of insert (relative) = 3 * Moles of vector (relative)
Desired moles of insert (relative) = 3 * 20 ng/kb = 60 ng/kb

Finally, calculate the mass of insert DNA needed:

Mass of insert = Desired moles of insert (relative) * Size of insert in kb
Mass of insert = 60 ng/kb * 1 kb = 60 ng

Therefore, you should add 60 ng of insert DNA to the ligation reaction.
