## Problem 1: Calculating Nucleotide Percentages (Chargaff's Rule)

A double-stranded DNA molecule contains 20% Adenine (A). Calculate the percentages of Thymine (T), Guanine (G), and Cytosine (C) in this DNA molecule.

**Solution:**

According to Chargaff's rules, in a double-stranded DNA molecule:
*   The amount of Adenine (A) is equal to the amount of Thymine (T). (A = T)
*   The amount of Guanine (G) is equal to the amount of Cytosine (C). (G = C)
*   The sum of all bases is 100% (A + T + G + C = 100%).

Given: A = 20%

1.  **Calculate T:** Since A = T, then T = 20%.

2.  **Calculate G + C:**
    A + T + G + C = 100%
    20% + 20% + G + C = 100%
    40% + G + C = 100%
    G + C = 100% - 40% = 60%

3.  **Calculate G and C:** Since G = C, and G + C = 60%:
    G = 60% / 2 = 30%
    C = 60% / 2 = 30%

Therefore, the percentages are: Thymine (T) = 20%, Guanine (G) = 30%, and Cytosine (C) = 30%.

## Problem 2: Calculating Number of Nucleotides in a DNA Segment

A segment of a DNA molecule is 100 base pairs (bp) long. How many nucleotides are present in this segment?

**Solution:**

*   A base pair (bp) consists of two nucleotides (one on each strand) joined by hydrogen bonds.
*   Therefore, 1 base pair = 2 nucleotides.

Given: Length of DNA segment = 100 base pairs

Number of nucleotides = Length in base pairs * 2
Number of nucleotides = 100 bp * 2 nucleotides/bp = 200 nucleotides

Therefore, there are 200 nucleotides present in a 100 base pair DNA segment.
