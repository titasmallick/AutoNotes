## Problem 1: Exponential Population Growth

A bacterial population starts with 100 individuals and doubles every hour. How many bacteria will be present after 5 hours, assuming unlimited resources?

**Solution:**

This is an example of exponential growth. The formula for exponential growth is N_t = N_0 * 2^t, where:
*   N_t = population size after time t
*   N_0 = initial population size
*   t = number of doubling periods

Given:
*   N_0 = 100
*   t = 5 hours

N_5 = 100 * 2^5
N_5 = 100 * 32
N_5 = 3200

Therefore, after 5 hours, there will be 3200 bacteria.

## Problem 2: Population Density Calculation

In a forest, there are 500 deer in an area of 10 square kilometers. Calculate the population density of deer in this forest.

**Solution:**

Population density is calculated as the number of individuals per unit area or volume.

Population Density = (Number of individuals) / (Area)

Given:
*   Number of individuals = 500 deer
*   Area = 10 km²

Population Density = 500 deer / 10 km² = 50 deer/km²

Therefore, the population density of deer in this forest is 50 deer per square kilometer.
