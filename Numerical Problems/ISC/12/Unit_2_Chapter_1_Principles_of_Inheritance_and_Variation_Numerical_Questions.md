### Question 1: Monohybrid Cross

In pea plants, the allele for tallness (T) is dominant over the allele for dwarfness (t). A heterozygous tall plant is crossed with a dwarf plant. What will be the phenotypic and genotypic ratio of the offspring?

**Solution:**

*   **Parental Genotypes:** Tt (heterozygous tall) x tt (dwarf)
*   **Gametes from Tt parent:** T and t
*   **Gametes from tt parent:** t
*   **Punnett Square:**

| | T | t |
| :--- | :-- | :-- |
| **t** | Tt | tt |

*   **Genotypic Ratio:** 1 Tt : 1 tt
*   **Phenotypic Ratio:** 1 Tall : 1 Dwarf

### Question 2: Dihybrid Cross

In pea plants, round seeds (R) are dominant to wrinkled seeds (r), and yellow seeds (Y) are dominant to green seeds (y). A plant that is heterozygous for both traits is self-pollinated. What is the probability of obtaining an offspring that is homozygous recessive for both traits?

**Solution:**

*   **Parental Genotypes:** RrYy x RrYy
*   **Gametes from each parent:** RY, Ry, rY, ry
*   To find the probability of an offspring that is homozygous recessive for both traits (rryy), we can consider the probabilities for each trait separately.
    *   The probability of obtaining `rr` from a `Rr x Rr` cross is 1/4.
    *   The probability of obtaining `yy` from a `Yy x Yy` cross is 1/4.
*   **Combined Probability:** The probability of both events occurring together is the product of their individual probabilities.
    *   Probability of `rryy` = (Probability of `rr`) x (Probability of `yy`) = (1/4) x (1/4) = 1/16.

Therefore, the probability of obtaining an offspring that is homozygous recessive for both traits is **1/16**.

### Question 3: Incomplete Dominance

In snapdragons, flower color is an example of incomplete dominance. The allele for red flowers (R) is incompletely dominant to the allele for white flowers (r). The heterozygous genotype (Rr) results in pink flowers. If two pink-flowered snapdragons are crossed, what are the expected phenotypic and genotypic ratios in the offspring?

**Solution:**

*   **Parental Genotypes:** Rr (pink) x Rr (pink)
*   **Gametes from each parent:** R and r
*   **Punnett Square:**

| | R | r |
| :--- | :-- | :-- |
| **R** | RR | Rr |
| **r** | Rr | rr |

*   **Genotypic Ratio:** 1 RR : 2 Rr : 1 rr
*   **Phenotypic Ratio:** 1 Red : 2 Pink : 1 White

### Question 4: Codominance and Blood Groups

A man with blood group A marries a woman with blood group B. They have a child with blood group O. What are the genotypes of the parents and the child? What is the probability of them having a child with blood group AB?

**Solution:**

*   For the child to have blood group O (genotype `ii`), they must inherit an `i` allele from each parent.
*   This means both parents must carry the recessive `i` allele.
*   **Parental Genotypes:**
    *   Man with blood group A: I<sup>A</sup>i
    *   Woman with blood group B: I<sup>B</sup>i
*   **Child's Genotype:** ii (blood group O)
*   **Probability of a child with blood group AB (I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>B</sup>):**
    *   We can use a Punnett square to determine the probabilities of all possible offspring genotypes.

| | I<sup>A</sup> | i |
| :--- | :--- | :-- |
| **I<sup>B</sup>** | I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>B</sup> | I<sup>B</sup>i |
| **i** | I<sup>A</sup>i | ii |

*   From the Punnett square, the probability of having a child with genotype I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>B</sup> (blood group AB) is **1/4 or 25%**.

### Question 5: Sex-Linked Inheritance

Hemophilia is an X-linked recessive disorder. A man with normal blood clotting marries a woman who is a carrier for hemophilia. What is the probability of their children having hemophilia?

**Solution:**

*   Let X<sup>H</sup> be the allele for normal blood clotting and X<sup>h</sup> be the allele for hemophilia.
*   **Parental Genotypes:**
    *   Man with normal clotting: X<sup>H</sup>Y
    *   Carrier woman: X<sup>H</sup>X<sup>h</sup>
*   **Punnett Square:**

| | X<sup>H</sup> | Y |
| :--- | :--- | :-- |
| **X<sup>H</sup>** | X<sup>H</sup>X<sup>H</sup> | X<sup>H</sup>Y |
| **X<sup>h</sup>** | X<sup>H</sup>X<sup>h</sup> | X<sup>h</sup>Y |

*   **Offspring Genotypes and Phenotypes:**
    *   X<sup>H</sup>X<sup>H</sup>: Normal daughter (25%)
    *   X<sup>H</sup>X<sup>h</sup>: Carrier daughter (25%)
    *   X<sup>H</sup>Y: Normal son (25%)
    *   X<sup>h</sup>Y: Son with hemophilia (25%)

*   **Probability:**
    *   The probability of having a child with hemophilia is **1/4 or 25%**.
    *   The probability of having a son with hemophilia is **1/2 or 50%** (of all male offspring).
    *   The probability of having a daughter with hemophilia is **0%**.
