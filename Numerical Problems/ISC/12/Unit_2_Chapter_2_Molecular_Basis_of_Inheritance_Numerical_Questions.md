### Question 1: DNA Structure and Chargaff's Rule

A segment of DNA has 1000 base pairs. The number of adenine bases is 200. What is the number of cytosine bases in this segment?

**Solution:**

*   **Total base pairs:** 1000
*   **Total number of bases:** 1000 x 2 = 2000
*   According to Chargaff's rule, the amount of Adenine (A) is equal to the amount of Thymine (T), and the amount of Guanine (G) is equal to the amount of Cytosine (C).
    *   A = T = 200
*   **Total A + T:** 200 + 200 = 400
*   **Remaining bases (G + C):** 2000 - 400 = 1600
*   Since G = C, the number of cytosine bases is:
    *   C = 1600 / 2 = 800

Therefore, there are **800 cytosine bases** in this segment of DNA.

### Question 2: DNA Length Calculation

The distance between two consecutive base pairs in a DNA molecule is 0.34 nm. If the length of a DNA molecule is 1.36 mm, calculate the number of base pairs in this DNA.

**Solution:**

*   **Length of DNA:** 1.36 mm = 1.36 x 10<sup>6</sup> nm (since 1 mm = 10<sup>6</sup> nm)
*   **Distance between base pairs:** 0.34 nm
*   **Number of base pairs = (Total length of DNA) / (Distance between two base pairs)**
    *   Number of base pairs = (1.36 x 10<sup>6</sup> nm) / (0.34 nm/bp)
    *   Number of base pairs = 4 x 10<sup>6</sup> bp

Therefore, there are **4 x 10<sup>6</sup> base pairs** in this DNA molecule.

### Question 3: Genetic Code and Polypeptide Chain

A polypeptide chain has 50 amino acids. What is the minimum number of nucleotides in the mRNA that codes for this polypeptide?

**Solution:**

*   The genetic code is a triplet code, meaning that 3 nucleotides code for 1 amino acid.
*   **Number of amino acids:** 50
*   **Number of nucleotides for amino acids:** 50 amino acids x 3 nucleotides/amino acid = 150 nucleotides.
*   In addition to the codons for the amino acids, the mRNA also has a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) to terminate translation. A stop codon also consists of 3 nucleotides.
*   **Total number of nucleotides:** 150 (for amino acids) + 3 (for stop codon) = 153 nucleotides.

Therefore, the minimum number of nucleotides in the mRNA that codes for this polypeptide is **153**.

### Question 4: DNA Replication and Isotopes

If a DNA molecule is replicated for two generations in a medium containing <sup>14</sup>N, starting with a hybrid DNA molecule (<sup>15</sup>N-<sup>14</sup>N), what will be the ratio of hybrid DNA to light DNA in the second generation?

**Solution:**

*   **Starting DNA:** One hybrid molecule (<sup>15</sup>N-<sup>14</sup>N).
*   **First Generation (in <sup>14</sup>N medium):**
    *   The hybrid DNA will replicate semi-conservatively.
    *   The two strands (<sup>15</sup>N and <sup>14</sup>N) will separate, and each will serve as a template for a new <sup>14</sup>N strand.
    *   This will result in two DNA molecules:
        *   One hybrid molecule (<sup>15</sup>N-<sup>14</sup>N)
        *   One light molecule (<sup>14</sup>N-<sup>14</sup>N)
*   **Second Generation (in <sup>14</sup>N medium):**
    *   The two molecules from the first generation will replicate.
    *   The hybrid molecule (<sup>15</sup>N-<sup>14</sup>N) will produce one hybrid (<sup>15</sup>N-<sup>14</sup>N) and one light (<sup>14</sup>N-<sup>14</sup>N) molecule.
    *   The light molecule (<sup>14</sup>N-<sup>14</sup>N) will produce two light (<sup>14</sup>N-<sup>14</sup>N) molecules.
    *   **Total molecules in the second generation:** 4
        *   1 hybrid molecule (<sup>15</sup>N-<sup>14</sup>N)
        *   3 light molecules (<sup>14</sup>N-<sup>14</sup>N)
*   **Ratio of hybrid to light DNA:** 1 : 3

Therefore, the ratio of hybrid DNA to light DNA in the second generation will be **1:3**.
