### Question 1: Species-Area Relationship

The species-area relationship is given by the equation log S = log C + Z log A. If the value of the regression coefficient (Z) is 0.2, the Y-intercept (C) is 0.5, and the area (A) is 100 square kilometers, what is the species richness (S)?

**Solution:**

*   **Given Equation:** log S = log C + Z log A
*   **Given Values:**
    *   Z = 0.2
    *   C = 0.5
    *   A = 100
*   **Substitute the values into the equation:**
    *   log S = log(0.5) + 0.2 * log(100)
    *   log S = -0.301 + 0.2 * 2
    *   log S = -0.301 + 0.4
    *   log S = 0.099
*   **To find S, we take the antilog of both sides:**
    *   S = 10<sup>0.099</sup>
    *   S ≈ 1.256

Therefore, the species richness (S) is approximately **1.26**.

### Question 2: Calculating the Regression Coefficient (Z)

In a study of a forest ecosystem, it was found that the species richness (S) is 10 when the area (A) is 1000 square kilometers. If the Y-intercept (C) is 2, what is the value of the regression coefficient (Z)?

**Solution:**

*   **Given Equation:** log S = log C + Z log A
*   **Given Values:**
    *   S = 10
    *   A = 1000
    *   C = 2
*   **Substitute the values into the equation:**
    *   log(10) = log(2) + Z * log(1000)
    *   1 = 0.301 + Z * 3
*   **Solve for Z:**
    *   1 - 0.301 = 3Z
    *   0.699 = 3Z
    *   Z = 0.699 / 3
    *   Z ≈ 0.233

Therefore, the value of the regression coefficient (Z) is approximately **0.233**.

### Question 3: Impact of Area on Species Richness

For a particular group of organisms, the species-area relationship is described by the equation S = 5A<sup>0.3</sup>. If the area is increased from 100 km² to 200 km², what is the percentage increase in species richness?

**Solution:**

*   **Given Equation:** S = 5A<sup>0.3</sup>
*   **Case 1: Area (A1) = 100 km²**
    *   S1 = 5 * (100)<sup>0.3</sup>
    *   S1 = 5 * (10<sup>2</sup>)<sup>0.3</sup>
    *   S1 = 5 * 10<sup>0.6</sup>
    *   S1 ≈ 5 * 3.981 = 19.905
*   **Case 2: Area (A2) = 200 km²**
    *   S2 = 5 * (200)<sup>0.3</sup>
    *   S2 = 5 * (2 * 100)<sup>0.3</sup>
    *   S2 = 5 * 2<sup>0.3</sup> * 100<sup>0.3</sup>
    *   S2 ≈ 5 * 1.231 * 3.981 = 24.50
*   **Percentage Increase:**
    *   Increase = S2 - S1 = 24.50 - 19.905 = 4.595
    *   Percentage Increase = (Increase / S1) * 100
    *   Percentage Increase = (4.595 / 19.905) * 100 ≈ 23.08%

Therefore, the percentage increase in species richness is approximately **23.08%**.
