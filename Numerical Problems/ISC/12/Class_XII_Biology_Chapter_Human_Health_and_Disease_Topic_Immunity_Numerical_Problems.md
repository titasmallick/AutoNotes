## Problem 1: Antibody Production Rate (Conceptual)

After a primary exposure to an antigen, the body starts producing antibodies after about 7 days, and the antibody level peaks around 14 days. In a secondary exposure to the same antigen, antibodies are produced within 2 days and reach a much higher peak in 7 days. If the primary response produces 100 units of antibodies at its peak, and the secondary response produces 10 times more antibodies, how many units of antibodies are produced at the peak of the secondary response?

**Solution:**

*   Peak antibody units in primary response = 100 units
*   Secondary response produces 10 times more antibodies than primary response.

Antibody units in secondary response = 100 units * 10 = 1000 units

Therefore, 1000 units of antibodies are produced at the peak of the secondary response.

## Problem 2: Vaccine Efficacy (Conceptual)

In a clinical trial for a new vaccine, out of 1000 vaccinated individuals, 20 contracted the disease. In a control group of 1000 unvaccinated individuals, 200 contracted the disease. Calculate the efficacy of the vaccine.

**Solution:**

Vaccine efficacy is a measure of how well a vaccine prevents disease. It can be calculated using the formula:

Vaccine Efficacy = ((Rate in unvaccinated group - Rate in vaccinated group) / Rate in unvaccinated group) * 100

*   Rate in unvaccinated group = (Number of unvaccinated individuals who contracted disease / Total unvaccinated individuals) = 200 / 1000 = 0.2
*   Rate in vaccinated group = (Number of vaccinated individuals who contracted disease / Total vaccinated individuals) = 20 / 1000 = 0.02

Vaccine Efficacy = ((0.2 - 0.02) / 0.2) * 100
Vaccine Efficacy = (0.18 / 0.2) * 100
Vaccine Efficacy = 0.9 * 100 = 90%

Therefore, the efficacy of the vaccine is 90%.
