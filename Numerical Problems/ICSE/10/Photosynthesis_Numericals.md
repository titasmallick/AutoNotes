# Numerical Problems: Photosynthesis

**Question 1:** In an experiment demonstrating that oxygen is released during photosynthesis, an aquatic plant (Hydrilla) releases 80 bubbles in 4 minutes when placed in bright sunlight. When the same setup is moved to a dimly lit area, the plant releases only 20 bubbles in 4 minutes.
(a) What is the rate of photosynthesis in bright sunlight (in bubbles/min)?
(b) What is the rate of photosynthesis in dim light (in bubbles/min)?
(c) Calculate the percentage decrease in the rate of photosynthesis when the plant was moved to dim light.

**Answer:**
*   **(a) Rate in bright sunlight:**
    *   Rate = Total bubbles / Time
    *   Rate = 80 bubbles / 4 minutes = **20 bubbles/min**
*   **(b) Rate in dim light:**
    *   Rate = Total bubbles / Time
    *   Rate = 20 bubbles / 4 minutes = **5 bubbles/min**
*   **(c) Percentage decrease in rate:**
    *   **Step 1: Find the decrease in rate.**
        *   Decrease = Rate in bright light - Rate in dim light
        *   Decrease = 20 - 5 = 15 bubbles/min
    *   **Step 2: Calculate the percentage decrease.**
        *   Percentage Decrease = (Decrease / Original Rate) × 100
        *   Percentage Decrease = (15 / 20) × 100
        *   Percentage Decrease = 0.75 × 100 = **75%**
