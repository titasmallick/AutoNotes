# Numerical Problems: Population

**Question 1:** A country has a population of 150 million people and a total land area of 3 million square kilometers. Calculate the population density.

**Answer:**
*   **Formula:** Population Density = Total Population / Total Land Area
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Population Density = 150,000,000 / 3,000,000
    *   Population Density = **50 people per square kilometer**.

**Question 2:** In a city with a population of 200,000, there were 4,000 live births and 1,600 deaths in a single year. Calculate the birth rate and death rate for that year.

**Answer:**
*   **Birth Rate Formula:** Birth Rate = (Number of live births / Total population) × 1000
*   **Birth Rate Calculation:**
    *   Birth Rate = (4,000 / 200,000) × 1000
    *   Birth Rate = 0.02 × 1000 = **20 per thousand**.
*   **Death Rate Formula:** Death Rate = (Number of deaths / Total population) × 1000
*   **Death Rate Calculation:**
    *   Death Rate = (1,600 / 200,000) × 1000
    *   Death Rate = 0.008 × 1000 = **8 per thousand**.
