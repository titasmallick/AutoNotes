## Problem 1: Monohybrid Cross

In pea plants, tall (T) is dominant over dwarf (t). If a homozygous tall pea plant is crossed with a homozygous dwarf pea plant, what will be the phenotypic and genotypic ratios of the F1 generation?

**Solution:**

*   **Parental Generation (P):** Homozygous Tall (TT) x Homozygous Dwarf (tt)
*   **Gametes:** T, t
*   **F1 Generation:** All Tt (Tall)

**Phenotypic Ratio:** All Tall (100% Tall)
**Genotypic Ratio:** All Heterozygous (100% Tt)

## Problem 2: Dihybrid Cross

In pea plants, round seeds (R) are dominant over wrinkled seeds (r), and yellow seeds (Y) are dominant over green seeds (y). If a pea plant heterozygous for both traits (RrYy) is self-pollinated, what will be the phenotypic ratio of the offspring?

**Solution:**

This is a dihybrid cross. The gametes produced by RrYy will be RY, Ry, rY, ry.

Using a Punnett Square (16 squares):

|       | RY    | Ry    | rY    | ry    |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **RY**  | RRYY  | RRYy  | RrYY  | RrYy  |
| **Ry**  | RRYy  | RRyy  | RrYy  | Rryy  |
| **rY**  | RrYY  | RrYy  | rrYY  | rrYy  |
| **ry**  | RrYy  | Rryy  | rrYy  | rryy  |

**Phenotypes and their counts:**

*   Round, Yellow (R_Y_): 9 (RRYY, RRYy, RrYY, RrYy)
*   Round, Green (R_yy): 3 (RRyy, Rryy)
*   Wrinkled, Yellow (rrY_): 3 (rrYY, rrYy)
*   Wrinkled, Green (rryy): 1 (rryy)

**Phenotypic Ratio:** 9 (Round, Yellow) : 3 (Round, Green) : 3 (Wrinkled, Yellow) : 1 (Wrinkled, Green)
