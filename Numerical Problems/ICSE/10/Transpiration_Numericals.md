# Numerical Problems: Transpiration

**Question 1:** A student uses a Ganong's potometer to measure the rate of water uptake by a leafy shoot. The experiment shows that the air bubble moved a distance of 50 mm in 15 minutes. The capillary tube of the potometer has a radius of 0.7 mm. Calculate the rate of water uptake in mm³/min. (Assume π = 3.14).

**Answer:**
*   **Step 1: Calculate the cross-sectional area of the capillary tube.**
    *   Area = πr²
    *   Area = 3.14 × (0.7 mm)²
    *   Area = 3.14 × 0.49 mm²
    *   Area = 1.5386 mm²
*   **Step 2: Calculate the total volume of water taken up.**
    *   Volume = Area × Distance
    *   Volume = 1.5386 mm² × 50 mm
    *   Volume = 76.93 mm³
*   **Step 3: Calculate the rate of water uptake per minute.**
    *   Rate = Total Volume / Time
    *   Rate = 76.93 mm³ / 15 min
    *   Rate ≈ **5.13 mm³/min**

**Question 2:** A potted plant was weighed and found to be 5.6 kg. The pot and the soil surface were covered with a waterproof plastic sheet. After keeping the plant in bright sunlight for 5 hours, its weight was measured again and found to be 5.54 kg. What is the rate of water loss by transpiration in g/hour?

**Answer:**
*   **Step 1: Calculate the total weight loss.**
    *   Total weight loss = Initial weight - Final weight
    *   Total weight loss = 5.6 kg - 5.54 kg = 0.06 kg
*   **Step 2: Convert the weight loss to grams.**
    *   0.06 kg × 1000 g/kg = 60 g
*   **Step 3: Calculate the rate of transpiration per hour.**
    *   Rate = Total water loss / Time
    *   Rate = 60 g / 5 hours
    *   Rate = **12 g/hour**
