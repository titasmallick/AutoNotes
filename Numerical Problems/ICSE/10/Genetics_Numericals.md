# Numerical Problems: Genetics

**Question 1:** In pea plants, tallness (T) is dominant over dwarfness (t). A heterozygous tall plant (Tt) is crossed with a homozygous dwarf plant (tt). What are the expected phenotypic and genotypic ratios in the offspring?

**Answer:**
*   **Cross:** Tt × tt
*   **Gametes from Tt:** T, t
*   **Gametes from tt:** t
*   **Punnett Square:**
| | T | t |
|---|---|---|
| t | Tt | tt |
| t | Tt | tt |
*   **Genotypic Ratio:** 1 Tt : 1 tt (or 50% Tt, 50% tt)
*   **Phenotypic Ratio:** 1 Tall : 1 Dwarf (or 50% Tall, 50% Dwarf)

**Question 2:** In pea plants, round seeds (R) are dominant to wrinkled seeds (r), and yellow seeds (Y) are dominant to green seeds (y). A plant that is heterozygous for both traits (RrYy) is self-pollinated. What is the probability of obtaining an offspring with wrinkled, green seeds?

**Answer:**
*   **Cross:** RrYy × RrYy
*   The standard phenotypic ratio for a dihybrid cross between two heterozygous parents is **9:3:3:1**.
    *   9 Round, Yellow
    *   3 Round, Green
    *   3 Wrinkled, Yellow
    *   1 Wrinkled, Green
*   The phenotype "wrinkled, green" corresponds to the genotype **rryy**.
*   The probability of obtaining an offspring with this phenotype is **1/16**.

**Question 3:** A man with normal vision marries a woman who is a carrier for colour blindness (an X-linked recessive trait). Let Xc represent the allele for colour blindness and X represent the normal allele. What is the probability that their son will be colour-blind? What is the probability that their daughter will be a carrier?

**Answer:**
*   **Man's Genotype:** XY (Normal vision)
*   **Woman's Genotype:** XcX (Carrier)
*   **Punnett Square:**
| | X | Y |
|---|---|---|
| Xc | XcX | XcY |
| X | XX | XY |
*   **Offspring Possibilities:**
    *   Daughters: XX (Normal), XcX (Carrier)
    *   Sons: XY (Normal), XcY (Colour-blind)
*   **Probability for a son to be colour-blind:** There is a 1 in 2 chance, or **50%**.
*   **Probability for a daughter to be a carrier:** There is a 1 in 2 chance, or **50%**.
