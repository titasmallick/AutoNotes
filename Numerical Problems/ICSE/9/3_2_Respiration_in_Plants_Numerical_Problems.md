# Chapter 3.2: Respiration in Plants - Numerical Problems

**Question 1:**
In aerobic respiration, one molecule of glucose is completely broken down. How many molecules of ATP are typically produced from this process?

**Answer 1:**
In aerobic respiration, approximately 38 molecules of ATP are produced from one molecule of glucose.

**Question 2:**
Compare the energy yield of aerobic respiration versus anaerobic respiration (alcoholic fermentation) from one molecule of glucose. What is the difference in ATP molecules produced?

**Answer 2:**
Aerobic respiration yields approximately 38 ATP molecules per glucose molecule.
Anaerobic respiration (alcoholic fermentation) yields only 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule.
The difference in ATP molecules produced is 38 - 2 = 36 ATP molecules.

**Question 3:**
Write the balanced chemical equation for aerobic respiration, indicating the reactants and products.

**Answer 3:**
C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Energy (38 ATP)
(Glucose + Oxygen → Carbon Dioxide + Water + Energy)

**Question 4:**
Write the balanced chemical equation for anaerobic respiration (alcoholic fermentation) in plants/yeast, indicating the reactants and products.

**Answer 4:**
C₆H₁₂O₆ → 2C₂H₅OH + 2CO₂ + Energy (2 ATP)
(Glucose → Ethanol + Carbon Dioxide + Energy)

**Question 5:**
If a plant cell needs to produce 76 molecules of ATP through aerobic respiration, how many glucose molecules would it need to break down?

**Answer 5:**
Since 1 glucose molecule yields 38 ATP molecules in aerobic respiration:
Number of glucose molecules = Total ATP needed / ATP per glucose molecule
Number of glucose molecules = 76 ATP / 38 ATP/glucose = 2 glucose molecules.
