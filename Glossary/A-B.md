### Abiotic
**Definition:** Non-living chemical and physical parts of the environment that affect living organisms and the functioning of ecosystems. These factors can be categorized into several types, including climatic (e.g., sunlight, temperature, humidity, wind), edaphic (e.g., soil type, pH, mineral content), and social (e.g., water availability, altitude, pressure).

**Examples:**
*   **Sunlight:** Essential for photosynthesis in plants.
*   **Temperature:** Affects the metabolic rates of organisms.
*   **Water:** Crucial for all known forms of life.
*   **Soil:** Provides nutrients and a substrate for plants.

**Context/Function:** Abiotic factors are fundamental to the structure and functioning of ecosystems. They determine which organisms can survive and thrive in a particular environment. For example, a desert ecosystem is characterized by high temperatures, low rainfall, and sandy soil, which supports a unique community of plants and animals adapted to these conditions.

### Adaptation
**Definition:** A trait with a current functional role in the life of an organism that is maintained and evolved by means of natural selection. Adaptations can be structural, behavioral, or physiological. They arise from the gradual modification of existing structures over long periods of time.

**Examples:**
*   **Structural:** The streamlined body of a dolphin, which reduces drag in the water.
*   **Behavioral:** The migration of birds to warmer climates during the winter.
*   **Physiological:** The ability of a camel to store large amounts of water.

**Context/Function:** Adaptations are essential for the survival and reproduction of organisms. They allow organisms to cope with the challenges of their environment, such as finding food, avoiding predators, and attracting mates. The process of adaptation is a key mechanism of evolution.

### Allele
**Definition:** One of a number of alternative forms of the same gene or same genetic locus. Alleles are responsible for the variation in a particular trait. For example, the gene for eye color has several alleles, which can result in blue, brown, or green eyes.

**Examples:**
*   **Blood Type:** The ABO blood group system is determined by three alleles: A, B, and O.
*   **Hair Color:** The different hair colors in humans are determined by multiple alleles.
*   **Flower Color:** The color of a flower is determined by the alleles for that trait.

**Context/Function:** Alleles are the basis of genetic diversity within a population. This diversity is essential for the long-term survival of a species, as it allows populations to adapt to changing environmental conditions.

### ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)
**Definition:** A complex organic chemical that provides energy to drive many processes in living cells, e.g., muscle contraction, nerve impulse propagation, and chemical synthesis. ATP is often referred to as the "molecular unit of currency" of intracellular energy transfer.

**Examples:**
*   **Muscle Contraction:** ATP provides the energy for the sliding of actin and myosin filaments in muscle cells.
*   **Active Transport:** ATP is used to pump ions and molecules across cell membranes against their concentration gradients.
*   **DNA Synthesis:** ATP is one of the four nucleoside triphosphates that are used in the synthesis of DNA.

**Context/Function:** ATP is the primary energy source for most cellular processes. It is produced during cellular respiration and photosynthesis. The energy stored in ATP is released when it is hydrolyzed to ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate.

### Autotroph
**Definition:** An organism that produces complex organic compounds from simple substances present in its surroundings, generally using energy from light or inorganic chemical reactions. Autotrophs are the producers in a food chain, such as plants on land or algae in water.

**Examples:**
*   **Plants:** Use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.
*   **Algae:** A diverse group of aquatic organisms that are capable of producing their own food through photosynthesis.
*   **Cyanobacteria:** A phylum of bacteria that obtain their energy through photosynthesis.

**Context/Function:** Autotrophs are the foundation of all ecosystems. They provide the energy and organic matter that all other organisms need to survive. Without autotrophs, there would be no life on Earth.

### Biology
**Definition:** The natural science that studies life and living organisms, including their physical structure, chemical processes, molecular interactions, physiological mechanisms, development, and evolution. Biology is a vast and diverse field that is divided into many different sub-disciplines.

**Examples:**
*   **Zoology:** The study of animals.
*   **Botany:** The study of plants.
*   **Microbiology:** The study of microorganisms.
*   **Genetics:** The study of heredity and the variation of inherited characteristics.

**Context/Function:** Biology is essential for understanding the world around us. It helps us to understand how our bodies work, how to treat diseases, and how to protect the environment.

### Biotic
**Definition:** A living component of an ecosystem; for example, an organism, such as a plant or animal. Biotic factors can be categorized into three groups: producers, consumers, and decomposers.

**Examples:**
*   **Producers:** Plants, algae, and cyanobacteria.
*   **Consumers:** Animals that eat other organisms.
*   **Decomposers:** Bacteria and fungi that break down dead organic matter.

**Context/Function:** Biotic factors interact with each other and with abiotic factors to create a complex and dynamic ecosystem. The relationships between biotic factors can be beneficial, harmful, or neutral. For example, a predator-prey relationship is harmful to the prey but beneficial to the predator.
