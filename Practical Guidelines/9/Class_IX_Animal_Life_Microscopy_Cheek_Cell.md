# Class IX Practical: Animal Life - Microscopy (Human Cheek Cell)

## Objective
To prepare a temporary mount of human cheek cells and observe the structure of a typical animal cell.

## Guidelines
1.  **Sample Collection:** Gently scrape the inner lining of your cheek with a clean, sterile toothpick or a blunt end of a matchstick. Avoid vigorous scraping.
2.  **Mounting:** Transfer the scraped material to a drop of saline solution or water on a clean glass slide. Add a drop of methylene blue stain to highlight the nucleus.
3.  **Coverslip:** Gently lower a coverslip over the preparation, avoiding air bubbles.
4.  **Observation:** Observe the slide under a compound microscope at low and high power. Identify the cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus. Note the irregular shape and absence of a cell wall.
5.  **Drawing:** Draw a neat, labeled diagram of a few observed cheek cells.

## Expected Outcome
Clear microscopic observation of animal cells, highlighting the presence of a cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus, and the absence of a cell wall.
