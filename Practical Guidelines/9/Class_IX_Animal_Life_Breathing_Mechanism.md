# Class IX Practical: Animal Life - Breathing Mechanism (Bell Jar Experiment)

## Objective
To demonstrate the mechanism of breathing (inhalation and exhalation) using a bell jar model and compare it with human lungs.

## Guidelines
1.  **Model Setup:** Observe the bell jar model of the human respiratory system. It typically consists of:
    *   A bell jar (representing the thoracic cavity).
    *   A Y-shaped tube (representing trachea and bronchi).
    *   Two balloons (representing lungs) attached to the Y-tube.
    *   A rubber sheet (representing the diaphragm) tied to the open end of the bell jar.
2.  **Demonstration of Inhalation:** Pull the rubber sheet (diaphragm) downwards. Observe what happens to the balloons.
3.  **Demonstration of Exhalation:** Push the rubber sheet (diaphragm) upwards. Observe what happens to the balloons.
4.  **Comparison with Human Lungs:** Relate the movements in the model to the actual process in human breathing:
    *   Pulling diaphragm down -> diaphragm contracts and moves down, increasing thoracic volume -> air rushes into lungs (inhalation).
    *   Pushing diaphragm up -> diaphragm relaxes and moves up, decreasing thoracic volume -> air is forced out of lungs (exhalation).
5.  **Discussion:** Explain the role of pressure changes in the thoracic cavity during breathing.

## Expected Outcome
Clear understanding of the physical mechanism of breathing, demonstrating how changes in thoracic volume and pressure lead to air movement into and out of the lungs.
