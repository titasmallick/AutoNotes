# Class IX Practical: Plant Life - Flower Study (Cross-Pollinated Flower)

## Objective
To examine and identify the parts of a cross-pollinated flower, such as Hibiscus.

## Guidelines
1.  **Specimen Selection:** Obtain a fresh, large, and easily dissectible cross-pollinated flower (e.g., Hibiscus).
2.  **External Observation:** Observe the overall structure, color, scent, and presence of nectar guides.
3.  **Identification of Floral Whorls:** Identify and count the parts of each floral whorl:
    *   **Calyx:** Sepals (number, fusion).
    *   **Corolla:** Petals (number, fusion, arrangement).
    *   **Androecium:** Stamens (number, arrangement, fusion, anther structure).
    *   **Gynoecium:** Pistil/Carpels (stigma, style, ovary - note position and number of locules).
4.  **Dissection:** Carefully dissect the flower to separate its parts. Observe the arrangement of stamens and pistil.
5.  **Drawing:** Draw a neat, labeled diagram of the entire flower and its dissected parts.
6.  **Discussion:** Relate the observed features to adaptations for cross-pollination (e.g., large petals, prominent stamens/pistil, nectar).

## Expected Outcome
Ability to identify and label the different parts of a flower and understand their role in reproduction, particularly in the context of cross-pollination.
