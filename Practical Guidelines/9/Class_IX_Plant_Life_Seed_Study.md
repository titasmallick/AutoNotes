# Class IX Practical: Plant Life - Seed Study (Germinating Seeds)

## Objective
To examine and identify the plumule and radicle in germinating dicot (bean) and monocot (maize) seeds.

## Guidelines
1.  **Seed Preparation:** Soak bean and maize seeds in water overnight to initiate germination. Alternatively, use seeds that have been germinating for 2-3 days until the radicle and plumule are visible.
2.  **External Observation:** Observe the external features of both types of germinating seeds.
3.  **Dissection (if necessary):** For the bean seed, carefully remove the seed coat and separate the two cotyledons to expose the embryo. For the maize seed, cut a longitudinal section to view the embryo.
4.  **Identification:** Identify the following parts in both seeds:
    *   **Radicle:** The embryonic root, which emerges first.
    *   **Plumule:** The embryonic shoot, which develops into the stem and leaves.
    *   **Cotyledon(s):** Seed leaves that store food (two in bean, one in maize).
    *   **Seed Coat:** Outer protective layer.
5.  **Drawing:** Draw neat, labeled diagrams of the germinating bean and maize seeds, highlighting the plumule and radicle.

## Expected Outcome
Ability to identify the embryonic root (radicle) and shoot (plumule) in germinating monocot and dicot seeds, understanding their roles in seedling development.
