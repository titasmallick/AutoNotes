# Class IX Practical: Animal Life - Animal Specimen Identification

## Objective
To identify and classify various animal specimens from different phyla/classes of Non-Chordata and Chordata.

## Guidelines
1.  **Observation:** Carefully observe the external features of each provided specimen (preserved specimens, models, or detailed charts).
2.  **Key Characteristics:** Note down the distinguishing characteristics that help in classification (e.g., body symmetry, presence/absence of segmentation, appendages, type of skeleton, body covering, specialized organs).
3.  **Classification:** Based on the observed characteristics, identify the phylum/class to which the specimen belongs.
4.  **Drawing:** Draw neat, labeled diagrams of each specimen, highlighting its key identifying features.
5.  **Discussion:** Briefly describe the habitat, general characteristics, and economic importance (if any) of each identified group.

## Specimens for Identification

### Non-Chordata
*   **Porifera:** (e.g., Sycon, Spongilla) - Observe pores, osculum, simple body plan.
*   **Coelenterata (Cnidaria):** (e.g., Hydra, Obelia, Jellyfish) - Observe radial symmetry, tentacles, cnidoblasts.
*   **Platyhelminthes:** (e.g., Planaria, Liver fluke, Tapeworm) - Observe flat body, bilateral symmetry.
*   **Nemathelminthes (Aschelminthes):** (e.g., Ascaris, Filarial worm) - Observe cylindrical body, unsegmented.
*   **Annelida:** (e.g., Earthworm, Leech, Nereis) - Observe segmented body, setae/parapodia.
*   **Arthropoda:** (e.g., Prawn, Cockroach, Spider, Centipede, Millipede) - Observe jointed appendages, chitinous exoskeleton, segmented body.
*   **Mollusca:** (e.g., Snail, Mussel, Octopus) - Observe soft body, shell (often), muscular foot.
*   **Echinodermata:** (e.g., Starfish, Sea urchin) - Observe spiny skin, water vascular system, radial symmetry (adult).

### Chordata
*   **Pisces (Fish):** (e.g., Rohu, Shark) - Observe fins, scales, gills, streamlined body.
*   **Amphibia:** (e.g., Frog, Salamander) - Observe moist skin, limbs, dual habitat.
*   **Reptilia:** (e.g., Lizard, Snake, Turtle) - Observe dry scaly skin, crawling locomotion.
*   **Aves (Birds):** (e.g., Pigeon, Sparrow) - Observe feathers, wings, beak, hollow bones.
*   **Mammalia:** (e.g., Rat, Bat, Human skeleton/model) - Observe hair/fur, mammary glands, external ears.

## Expected Outcome
Ability to identify and classify common animal specimens into their respective phyla/classes based on their distinguishing morphological features.
