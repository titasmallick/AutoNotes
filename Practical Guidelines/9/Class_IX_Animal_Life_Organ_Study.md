# Class IX Practical: Animal Life - Organ Study (Lung and Skin)

## Objective
To identify and understand the basic structure and function of the human lung and skin using specimens, models, or charts.

## Guidelines

### 1. Lung
1.  **Identification:** Observe the external features of a lung specimen/model/chart (e.g., color, texture, lobes).
2.  **Internal Structure (Brief):** Understand the pathway of air: trachea -> bronchi -> bronchioles -> alveoli. Identify the pleura.
3.  **Function:** Understand its primary role in gaseous exchange (oxygen intake, carbon dioxide release).
4.  **Drawing:** Draw a neat, labeled diagram of the human lung and its associated air passages.

### 2. Skin
1.  **Identification:** Observe a model or chart of the human skin.
2.  **Layers:** Identify the main layers: epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue (hypodermis).
3.  **Associated Structures:** Locate hair follicles, sebaceous glands, sweat glands, nerve endings, and blood vessels.
4.  **Function:** Understand its multiple roles: protection, temperature regulation, sensation, excretion, vitamin D synthesis.
5.  **Drawing:** Draw a neat, labeled diagram of a cross-section of the human skin.

## Expected Outcome
Ability to identify and label the key parts of the human lung and skin, and understand their basic anatomical organization and physiological functions.
