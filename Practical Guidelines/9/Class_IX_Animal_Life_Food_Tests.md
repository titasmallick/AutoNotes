# Class IX Practical: Animal Life - Food Tests

## Objective
To identify the presence of sugar, starch, protein, and fat in given food samples using appropriate biochemical tests.

## Guidelines
1.  **Preparation:** Prepare dilute solutions or suspensions of known samples (e.g., glucose solution, starch solution, egg albumin, oil) and unknown food samples.
2.  **Test Procedures:** Follow standard protocols for each test:
    *   **Sugar (Reducing Sugar):** Benedict's test (heating required). Observe color change from blue to green, yellow, orange, or brick-red precipitate.
    *   **Starch:** Iodine test. Observe color change from yellowish-brown to blue-black.
    *   **Protein:** Biuret test. Observe color change from blue to violet/purple.
    *   **Fat:** Emulsion test (alcohol and water). Observe the formation of a milky white emulsion.
3.  **Observation:** Carefully observe color changes, precipitate formation, or other indicators.
4.  **Recording:** Create a table to record observations for both positive and negative controls, and for the unknown samples. Clearly state the inference for each test.

## Expected Outcome
A clear understanding of the chemical basis of food tests and the ability to accurately identify major food components.
