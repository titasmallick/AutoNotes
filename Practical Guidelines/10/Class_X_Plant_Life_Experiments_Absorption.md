# Class X Practical: Plant Life - Experiments (Absorption)

## Objective
To demonstrate the process of water absorption by a small herbaceous plant.

## Guidelines
1.  **Plant Selection:** Take a small, healthy herbaceous plant (e.g., Balsam, money plant cutting with roots).
2.  **Setup:** Fill a measuring cylinder or a narrow-mouthed bottle with water. Add a few drops of oil to the surface of the water to prevent evaporation.
3.  **Plant Placement:** Carefully insert the plant into the measuring cylinder, ensuring its roots are submerged in the water and the stem passes through a split cork or cotton plug to seal the mouth of the cylinder, preventing water loss by evaporation from the surface.
4.  **Initial Reading:** Note the initial water level in the measuring cylinder.
5.  **Observation:** Place the setup in a well-lit area (but not direct harsh sunlight to avoid excessive transpiration). Observe the water level in the cylinder after a few hours or overnight.
6.  **Recording:** Record the final water level and calculate the amount of water absorbed by the plant.

## Expected Outcome
A noticeable decrease in the water level in the measuring cylinder, demonstrating that the plant absorbs water through its roots.
