# Class X Practical: Plant Life - Transpiration

## Objective
To demonstrate the process of transpiration in plants and measure its rate.

## Guidelines

### 1. Bell Jar Demonstration
1.  **Setup:** Take a well-watered potted plant and cover the pot and soil surface with a plastic sheet to prevent evaporation from the soil.
2.  **Enclosure:** Place the potted plant under a bell jar. Seal the base of the bell jar to the ground or a glass plate to create an airtight enclosure.
3.  **Observation:** Place the setup in sunlight. Observe the inner surface of the bell jar after a few hours.
4.  **Expected Outcome:** Droplets of water will appear on the inner surface of the bell jar, demonstrating that plants release water vapor into the atmosphere through transpiration.

### 2. Cobalt Chloride Paper Test for Unequal Transpiration
1.  **Preparation:** Obtain dry cobalt chloride paper (blue in color).
2.  **Application:** Attach a piece of dry cobalt chloride paper to the upper surface and another piece to the lower surface of a healthy leaf using clips or adhesive tape.
3.  **Observation:** Observe the color change of the cobalt chloride paper on both surfaces over time.
4.  **Expected Outcome:** The cobalt chloride paper on the lower surface of the leaf will turn pink faster and more intensely than that on the upper surface, indicating a higher rate of transpiration from the lower epidermis due to the presence of more stomata.

### 3. Ganong’s Potometer – Measure Uptake of Water
1.  **Setup:** Assemble the Ganong's potometer. Ensure it is completely filled with water and free of air bubbles. Insert a freshly cut, healthy twig into the apparatus, ensuring an airtight seal.
2.  **Initial Reading:** Adjust the air bubble in the capillary tube to the starting point and note the initial reading.
3.  **Observation:** Place the potometer in different environmental conditions (e.g., light, fan, dark) and observe the movement of the air bubble along the capillary tube over a set period.
4.  **Calculation:** Calculate the rate of water uptake (and thus transpiration) by measuring the distance moved by the air bubble and the cross-sectional area of the capillary tube.
5.  **Expected Outcome:** The air bubble will move, indicating water uptake by the twig to compensate for water lost through transpiration. The rate of movement will vary with environmental factors.
