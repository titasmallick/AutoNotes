# Class X Practical: Animal Life - Sense Organ Identification (Ear and Eye)

## Objective
To identify and understand the internal structure of the human ear and eye using models or charts.

## Guidelines

### 1. Internal Structure of the Ear
1.  **Identification:** Identify the three main parts: outer ear, middle ear, and inner ear.
2.  **Outer Ear:** Pinna (auricle), external auditory canal.
3.  **Middle Ear:** Tympanic membrane (eardrum), ossicles (malleus, incus, stapes), Eustachian tube.
4.  **Inner Ear:** Cochlea (for hearing), semicircular canals (for balance), vestibule.
5.  **Function (Brief):** Understand the basic function of each part in hearing and balance.
6.  **Drawing:** Draw a neat, labeled diagram of the internal structure of the human ear.

### 2. Internal Structure of the Eye
1.  **Identification:** Identify the main layers and structures:
    *   **Outer Fibrous Layer:** Sclera, cornea.
    *   **Middle Vascular Layer (Uvea):** Choroid, ciliary body, iris, pupil.
    *   **Inner Neural Layer:** Retina (with photoreceptors, optic disc, macula lutea/fovea).
    *   **Lens:** Biconvex, transparent structure.
    *   **Chambers:** Anterior chamber (aqueous humor), posterior chamber (vitreous humor).
    *   **Muscles:** Extrinsic eye muscles.
2.  **Function (Brief):** Understand the basic function of each part in vision.
3.  **Drawing:** Draw a neat, labeled diagram of the internal structure of the human eye.

## Expected Outcome
Ability to identify and label the key internal parts of the human ear and eye, and understand their basic roles in the senses of hearing and sight.
