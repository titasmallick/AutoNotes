# Class X Practical: Plant Life - Microscopy (Mitosis Stages)

## Objective
To observe and identify different stages of mitosis from permanent slides.

## Guidelines
1.  **Microscope Setup:** Place the permanent slide of mitosis stages on the microscope stage. Start with the lowest power objective lens.
2.  **Focusing:** Adjust the coarse and fine adjustment knobs to bring the cells into clear focus.
3.  **Scanning:** Systematically scan the slide to locate cells undergoing different stages of mitosis (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase).
4.  **High Power Observation:** Once a mitotic stage is located, switch to a higher power objective lens for detailed observation.
5.  **Identification:** Identify the characteristic features of each stage:
    *   **Prophase:** Chromosomes condense, nuclear envelope disappears.
    *   **Metaphase:** Chromosomes align at the metaphase plate.
    *   **Anaphase:** Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles.
    *   **Telophase:** Chromosomes decondense, nuclear envelopes reform, cytokinesis begins.
6.  **Drawing:** Draw neat, labeled diagrams of each identified mitotic stage.

## Expected Outcome
Ability to recognize and differentiate between the various stages of cell division (mitosis) in plant cells from prepared slides.
