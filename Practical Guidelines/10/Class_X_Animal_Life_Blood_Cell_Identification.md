# Class X Practical: Animal Life - Blood Cell Identification

## Objective
To identify different types of blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets) from a permanent blood smear slide under a microscope.

## Guidelines
1.  **Microscope Setup:** Place the permanent slide of a blood smear on the microscope stage. Start with a low power objective lens and then switch to high power or oil immersion for detailed observation.
2.  **Focusing:** Adjust the focus to get a clear view of the blood cells.
3.  **Identification:** Systematically scan the slide and identify the following:
    *   **Red Blood Cells (Erythrocytes):** Biconcave, anucleated, numerous, pale yellow in color.
    *   **White Blood Cells (Leukocytes):** Larger than RBCs, nucleated, less numerous. Differentiate between:
        *   **Granulocytes:** Neutrophils (multi-lobed nucleus, fine granules), Eosinophils (bi-lobed nucleus, coarse red granules), Basophils (lobed nucleus, coarse blue/purple granules).
        *   **Agranulocytes:** Lymphocytes (large, round nucleus, scanty cytoplasm), Monocytes (kidney-shaped nucleus, abundant cytoplasm).
    *   **Platelets (Thrombocytes):** Small, irregular fragments, anucleated, clumped together.
4.  **Drawing:** Draw neat, labeled diagrams of each identified type of blood cell.

## Expected Outcome
Ability to distinguish and identify the different types of blood cells based on their morphology (size, shape, nucleus, presence/absence of granules) from a prepared blood smear.
