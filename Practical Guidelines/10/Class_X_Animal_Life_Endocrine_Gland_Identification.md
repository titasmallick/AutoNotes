# Class X Practical: Animal Life - Endocrine Gland Identification

## Objective
To identify the location and understand the basic function of major endocrine glands (adrenal, pancreas, thyroid, pituitary) using models or charts.

## Guidelines
1.  **Adrenal Gland:**
    *   **Location:** Identify its position on top of the kidneys.
    *   **Structure (Brief):** Note the cortex and medulla regions.
    *   **Function (Brief):** Understand its role in stress response (adrenaline, cortisol).
2.  **Pancreas:**
    *   **Location:** Identify its position behind the stomach.
    *   **Structure (Brief):** Note its dual exocrine and endocrine functions.
    *   **Function (Brief):** Understand its role in blood sugar regulation (insulin, glucagon).
3.  **Thyroid Gland:**
    *   **Location:** Identify its position in the neck, anterior to the trachea.
    *   **Structure (Brief):** Note its butterfly shape.
    *   **Function (Brief):** Understand its role in metabolism (thyroxine).
4.  **Pituitary Gland:**
    *   **Location:** Identify its position at the base of the brain, within the sella turcica.
    *   **Structure (Brief):** Note its anterior and posterior lobes.
    *   **Function (Brief):** Understand its role as the 'master gland' controlling other endocrine glands.

## Expected Outcome
Ability to identify the location of major endocrine glands in the human body and recall their primary hormonal functions.
