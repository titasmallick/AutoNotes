# Class X Practical: Plant Life - Photosynthesis

## Objective
To demonstrate the necessity of light, carbon dioxide, and chlorophyll for starch production during photosynthesis, and to show the release of oxygen during the process.

## Guidelines

### 1. Necessity of Light for Starch Production
1.  **Setup:** Destarch a potted plant by keeping it in the dark for 2-3 days. Cover a part of one leaf with a black paper or aluminum foil (using clips) and expose the plant to sunlight for 6-8 hours.
2.  **Starch Test:** Remove the leaf, remove the cover, boil the leaf in water, then in alcohol (in a water bath) to remove chlorophyll. Wash the leaf and perform an iodine test.
3.  **Expected Outcome:** The uncovered part of the leaf will turn blue-black (presence of starch), while the covered part will remain yellowish-brown (absence of starch), proving light is necessary for photosynthesis.

### 2. Necessity of Carbon Dioxide for Starch Production
1.  **Setup:** Destarch two potted plants. Place one plant under a bell jar with a watch glass containing KOH solution (absorbs CO₂). Place the other plant under a bell jar with a watch glass containing plain water (control). Seal the bell jars to the ground. Expose both setups to sunlight for 6-8 hours.
2.  **Starch Test:** Perform an iodine test on a leaf from each plant as described above.
3.  **Expected Outcome:** The leaf from the plant in the KOH setup will show no starch, while the control plant's leaf will show starch, proving CO₂ is necessary for photosynthesis.

### 3. Necessity of Chlorophyll for Starch Production
1.  **Setup:** Take a variegated leaf (e.g., from Croton or Coleus plant) that has green (chlorophyll) and non-green (no chlorophyll) areas. Expose the plant to sunlight for 6-8 hours.
2.  **Starch Test:** Perform an iodine test on the variegated leaf as described above.
3.  **Expected Outcome:** Only the green parts of the leaf will turn blue-black, while the non-green parts will remain yellowish-brown, proving chlorophyll is necessary for photosynthesis.

### 4. Release of Oxygen using Hydrilla/Elodea
1.  **Setup:** Place a sprig of Hydrilla or Elodea in a beaker containing pond water. Invert a test tube filled with water over the plant, ensuring the stem of the plant is inside the test tube.
2.  **Exposure:** Place the setup in bright sunlight.
3.  **Observation:** Observe the bubbles evolving from the cut end of the plant and collecting in the inverted test tube.
4.  **Gas Test:** After a sufficient amount of gas has collected, carefully remove the test tube and insert a glowing splint into it.
5.  **Expected Outcome:** The glowing splint will rekindle, confirming the presence of oxygen gas, thus demonstrating that oxygen is released during photosynthesis.
