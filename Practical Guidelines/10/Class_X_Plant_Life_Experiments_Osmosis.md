# Class X Practical: Plant Life - Experiments (Osmosis)

## Objective
To demonstrate the process of osmosis using the thistle funnel experiment and the potato osmoscope.

## Guidelines

### 1. Thistle Funnel Experiment
1.  **Setup:** Take a thistle funnel and tie a semi-permeable membrane (e.g., parchment paper, cellophane) tightly across its broad mouth.
2.  **Solution:** Fill the thistle funnel with a concentrated sugar solution (e.g., 20% sucrose solution).
3.  **Immersion:** Invert the thistle funnel and place its narrow tube into a beaker containing distilled water, ensuring the level of sugar solution in the funnel is initially higher than the water level in the beaker.
4.  **Observation:** Mark the initial level of the sugar solution in the stem of the thistle funnel. Observe the change in the level of the sugar solution over several hours.

### 2. Potato Osmoscope
1.  **Potato Preparation:** Peel a large potato and scoop out a cavity from one side, creating a cup-like structure. Ensure the base is flat.
2.  **Setup:** Fill the potato cavity with a concentrated sugar solution (e.g., 20% sucrose solution). Insert a pin or needle at the initial level of the solution.
3.  **Immersion:** Place the potato in a beaker containing distilled water, ensuring the water level in the beaker is below the level of the sugar solution in the cavity.
4.  **Observation:** Leave the setup undisturbed for several hours or overnight. Observe the change in the level of the sugar solution in the potato cavity.

## Expected Outcome
In both experiments, an increase in the level of the sugar solution will be observed, demonstrating the net movement of water from a region of higher water potential (distilled water) to a region of lower water potential (sugar solution) across a semi-permeable membrane, which is the process of osmosis.
