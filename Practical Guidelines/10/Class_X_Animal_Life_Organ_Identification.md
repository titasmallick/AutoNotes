# Class X Practical: Animal Life - Organ Identification

## Objective
To identify and understand the internal structure of the mammalian urinary system, heart, kidney, and the external view of the brain using models, charts, or preserved specimens.

## Guidelines

### 1. Urinary System
1.  **Identification:** Locate and identify the major organs of the urinary system: kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra.
2.  **Structure:** Understand the basic function of each part in urine formation and excretion.
3.  **Drawing:** Draw a neat, labeled diagram of the human urinary system.

### 2. Heart
1.  **Identification:** Identify the four chambers (right atrium, left atrium, right ventricle, left ventricle), major blood vessels (aorta, pulmonary artery, pulmonary veins, vena cavae), and valves (tricuspid, bicuspid/mitral, pulmonary, aortic).
2.  **Blood Flow:** Trace the path of blood through the heart and associated vessels.
3.  **Drawing:** Draw a neat, labeled diagram of the internal structure of the human heart.

### 3. Kidney
1.  **External View:** Identify the renal capsule, renal artery, renal vein, and ureter.
2.  **Internal Structure (Longitudinal Section):** Identify the renal cortex, renal medulla (with renal pyramids), renal pelvis, and calyces.
3.  **Function:** Understand the role of the kidney in filtration and urine formation.
4.  **Drawing:** Draw a neat, labeled diagram of the longitudinal section of a kidney.

### 4. External View of Brain
1.  **Identification:** Identify the major parts of the brain: cerebrum (with lobes), cerebellum, and brainstem (pons, medulla oblongata).
2.  **Surface Features:** Observe the gyri (ridges) and sulci (grooves) on the cerebrum.
3.  **Function (Brief):** Briefly understand the general functions associated with each major part.
4.  **Drawing:** Draw a neat, labeled diagram of the external view of the human brain.

## Expected Outcome
Ability to identify and label the key parts of the mammalian urinary system, heart, kidney, and brain, and understand their basic anatomical organization.
