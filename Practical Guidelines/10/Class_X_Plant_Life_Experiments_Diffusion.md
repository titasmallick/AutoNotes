# Class X Practical: Plant Life - Experiments (Diffusion)

## Objective
To demonstrate the process of diffusion using potassium permanganate in water.

## Guidelines
1.  **Setup:** Fill a beaker or a glass jar with clear water. Ensure the water is still and undisturbed.
2.  **Introduction of Substance:** Carefully drop a few crystals of potassium permanganate (KMnOâ‚„) into the bottom of the beaker. Avoid disturbing the water.
3.  **Observation:** Observe the beaker over time. Note how the purple color of potassium permanganate slowly spreads throughout the water, even without stirring.
4.  **Recording:** Record observations at regular intervals (e.g., every 5-10 minutes) until the color is uniformly distributed.
5.  **Explanation:** Explain that the movement of potassium permanganate particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration is due to diffusion.

## Expected Outcome
Clear visual demonstration of diffusion, illustrating the random movement of particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.
