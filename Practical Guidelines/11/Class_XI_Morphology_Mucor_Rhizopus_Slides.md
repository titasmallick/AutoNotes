# Class XI Practical: Morphology - Preparation of Temporary Slides of Mucor / Rhizopus

## Objective
To prepare and observe temporary microscopic slides of the fungi Mucor or Rhizopus.

## Guidelines
1.  **Culture Preparation:** Obtain a culture of Mucor or Rhizopus (commonly found on stale bread).
2.  **Slide Preparation:**
    *   Place a drop of lactophenol cotton blue stain on a clean glass slide.
    *   Gently touch a sterile needle to the fungal growth to pick up some mycelia and sporangia.
    *   Transfer the fungal material to the stain drop and gently tease it apart with needles to spread it.
    *   Carefully lower a coverslip over the preparation, avoiding air bubbles.
3.  **Observation:** Observe the slide under a compound microscope at low and high power. Identify key structures such as hyphae, sporangiophores, sporangia, and spores.
4.  **Drawing:** Draw neat, labeled diagrams of the observed structures.

## Expected Outcome
Successful preparation of a temporary mount and identification of the characteristic morphological features of Mucor or Rhizopus.
