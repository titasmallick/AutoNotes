# Class XI Practical: Cytology - T.S. of Monocot & Dicot Roots

## Objective
To prepare and observe temporary transverse sections (T.S.) of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous roots to study their anatomical differences.

## Guidelines
1.  **Sectioning:** Obtain fresh monocot (e.g., maize, onion) and dicot (e.g., gram, pea) roots. Cut very thin transverse sections using a sharp blade.
2.  **Staining:** Stain the sections with appropriate stains (e.g., safranin and fast green).
3.  **Mounting:** Mount the stained sections in glycerine or water on a clean slide and cover with a coverslip.
4.  **Observation:** Observe the slides under a compound microscope. Identify and compare:
    *   **Root Cap:** Protective layer at the tip (if whole root tip is used).
    *   **Epidermis:** Outermost layer, often with root hairs.
    *   **Cortex:** Broad region of parenchyma cells.
    *   **Endodermis:** Innermost layer of cortex with Casparian strips.
    *   **Vascular Bundles:** Arrangement (radial), number of xylem and phloem bundles (polyarch in monocots, di- to hexarch in dicots), presence/absence of pith.
5.  **Drawing:** Draw neat, labeled diagrams of both monocot and dicot root T.S., highlighting key differences.

## Expected Outcome
Clear understanding and ability to differentiate between the internal anatomical structures of monocot and dicot roots.
