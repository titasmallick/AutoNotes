# Class XI Practical: Spotting

## Objective
To identify and draw various biological specimens, slides, and experimental setups, and infer their characteristics or principles.

## Guidelines
For each item presented (slide, specimen, or experimental setup):
1.  **Identification:** Correctly identify the given item.
2.  **Drawing:** Make a neat, labeled diagram of the identified item. For slides, draw what is observed under the microscope. For specimens, draw the external features. For experimental setups, draw the arrangement of apparatus.
3.  **Observation:** Note down key observable features or results.
4.  **Inference/Comment:** Briefly explain the biological significance, principle demonstrated, or classification of the item.

    *   *Identify:* The setup demonstrating photosynthesis.
    *   *Draw:* Labeled diagram of the setup.
    *   *Observation:* Note gas bubble evolution or starch presence.
    *   *Inference:* Explain the process of photosynthesis and its requirements.
*   **Transpiration Pull:** (e.g., Cohesion-tension model demonstration)
    *   *Identify:* The setup demonstrating transpiration pull.
    *   *Draw:* Labeled diagram of the setup.
    *   *Observation:* Note water movement.
