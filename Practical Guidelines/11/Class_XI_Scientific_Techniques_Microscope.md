# Class XI Practical: Scientific Techniques - Microscope Study

## Objective
To understand the parts, functions, and proper handling of dissecting and compound microscopes.

## Guidelines
1.  **Identify Parts:** Locate and name all major parts of both the dissecting and compound microscopes (e.g., eyepiece, objective lenses, stage, focus knobs, light source, diaphragm).
2.  **Handling:** Learn the correct way to carry, place, and store the microscope.
3.  **Focusing:** Practice focusing on a specimen at different magnifications using both coarse and fine adjustment knobs.
4.  **Illumination:** Adjust the light intensity and diaphragm for optimal viewing.
5.  **Care and Maintenance:** Understand basic cleaning procedures and precautions to prevent damage.

## Expected Outcome
Proficiency in setting up, using, and maintaining both dissecting and compound microscopes for biological observations.
