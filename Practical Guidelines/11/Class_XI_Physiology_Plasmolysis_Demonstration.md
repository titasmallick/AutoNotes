# Class XI Practical: Physiology - Demonstration of Plasmolysis (Rhoeo Leaf/Onion Bulb)

## Objective
To observe the phenomenon of plasmolysis in plant cells when exposed to a hypertonic solution.

## Guidelines
1.  **Sample Preparation:** Obtain a thin epidermal peel from a Rhoeo leaf or an onion bulb scale.
2.  **Mounting:** Mount a small piece of the peel in a drop of distilled water on a clean slide and observe under a compound microscope to see normal turgid cells.
3.  **Inducing Plasmolysis:** Replace the distilled water with a hypertonic solution (e.g., 5% or 10% NaCl or sucrose solution) by adding it to one side of the coverslip and drawing it under with a piece of filter paper from the opposite side.
4.  **Observation:** Observe the cells under the microscope. Note the changes in the protoplast (cell membrane pulling away from the cell wall) as water leaves the cell.
5.  **Deplasmolysis (Optional):** Replace the hypertonic solution with distilled water and observe the recovery of the cells.

## Expected Outcome
Clear microscopic observation of plasmolysed cells, where the protoplast shrinks and detaches from the cell wall, illustrating the effect of osmosis in plant cells.
