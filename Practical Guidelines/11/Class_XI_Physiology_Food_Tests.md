# Class XI Practical: Physiology - Food Tests

## Objective
To identify the presence of starch, glucose, sucrose, proteins, and fats in given food samples using specific chemical tests and record positive and negative results.

## Guidelines
1.  **Preparation:** Prepare dilute solutions or suspensions of known samples (e.g., starch solution, glucose solution, egg albumin, oil) and unknown food samples.
2.  **Test Procedures:** Follow standard protocols for each test:
    *   **Starch:** Iodine test.
    *   **Glucose (Reducing Sugar):** Benedict's test (heating required).
    *   **Sucrose (Non-reducing Sugar):** Hydrolysis followed by Benedict's test.
    *   **Proteins:** Biuret test.
    *   **Fats:** Emulsion test (alcohol and water).
3.  **Observation:** Carefully observe color changes, precipitate formation, or other indicators.
4.  **Recording:** Create a table to record observations for both positive and negative controls, and for the unknown samples. Clearly state the inference for each test.

## Expected Outcome
A clear understanding of the chemical basis of food tests and the ability to accurately identify major food components.
