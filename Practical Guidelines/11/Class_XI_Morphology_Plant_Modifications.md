# Class XI Practical: Morphology - Identification of Modifications of Roots, Stems, and Leaves

## Objective
To identify and understand the structural modifications of roots, stems, and leaves for various functions such as support, storage, and reproduction.

## Guidelines
1.  **Specimen Collection:** Observe and collect various plant specimens exhibiting modifications (e.g., carrot/radish for storage root, banyan for prop root, ginger/potato for modified stem, pea tendril for leaf tendril, Opuntia for stem phylloclade).
2.  **Identification:** For each specimen, identify:
    *   The specific plant part that is modified (root, stem, or leaf).
    *   The type of modification (e.g., tap root for storage, rhizome, stem tendril, leaf spine).
    *   The adaptive function of the modification (e.g., food storage, support, vegetative propagation, protection).
3.  **Drawing and Labeling:** Draw neat, labeled diagrams of the observed modifications.

## Expected Outcome
Ability to recognize and classify different types of root, stem, and leaf modifications and explain their ecological significance.
