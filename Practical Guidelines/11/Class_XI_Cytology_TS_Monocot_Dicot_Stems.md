# Class XI Practical: Cytology - T.S. of Monocot & Dicot Stems

## Objective
To prepare and observe temporary transverse sections (T.S.) of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous stems to study their anatomical differences.

## Guidelines
1.  **Sectioning:** Obtain fresh monocot (e.g., maize, bamboo) and dicot (e.g., sunflower, pea) stems. Cut very thin transverse sections using a sharp blade.
2.  **Staining:** Stain the sections with appropriate stains (e.g., safranin and fast green for differential staining of lignified and cellulosic tissues).
3.  **Mounting:** Mount the stained sections in glycerine or water on a clean slide and cover with a coverslip.
4.  **Observation:** Observe the slides under a compound microscope. Identify and compare:
    *   **Epidermis:** Outer protective layer.
    *   **Cortex:** Ground tissue beneath epidermis.
    *   **Vascular Bundles:** Arrangement (scattered in monocots, ring in dicots), presence/absence of cambium.
    *   **Pith:** Central ground tissue (present in dicots, absent/reduced in monocots).
5.  **Drawing:** Draw neat, labeled diagrams of both monocot and dicot stem T.S., highlighting key differences.

## Expected Outcome
Clear understanding and ability to differentiate between the internal anatomical structures of monocot and dicot stems.
