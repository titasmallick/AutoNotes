# Class XI Practical: Morphology - Study of Phyllotaxy, Leaf Types, Venation, etc.

## Objective
To observe and identify different patterns of phyllotaxy, types of leaves (simple/compound), and venation patterns in various plant specimens.

## Guidelines
1.  **Specimen Collection:** Collect diverse plant specimens showing different arrangements of leaves, leaf types, and venation patterns.
2.  **Phyllotaxy:** Observe the arrangement of leaves on the stem and identify:
    *   **Alternate:** (e.g., China rose, mustard)
    *   **Opposite:** (e.g., Guava, Calotropis)
    *   **Whorled:** (e.g., Alstonia)
3.  **Leaf Types:** Examine leaves and distinguish between:
    *   **Simple Leaf:** (e.g., Mango, Guava)
    *   **Compound Leaf:** (e.g., Neem, Rose) - further classify as pinnately or palmately compound.
4.  **Venation:** Observe the arrangement of veins and veinlets in the leaf lamina and identify:
    *   **Reticulate Venation:** (e.g., Dicot leaves like peepal, mango)
    *   **Parallel Venation:** (e.g., Monocot leaves like grass, banana)

## Expected Outcome
Ability to accurately identify and classify phyllotaxy patterns, leaf types, and venation patterns in different plants.
