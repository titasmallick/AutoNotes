# Class XI Practical: Cytology - Stages of Mitosis in Onion Root Tips

## Objective
To prepare a temporary squash mount of onion root tips and observe different stages of mitosis.

## Guidelines
1.  **Root Tip Preparation:** Obtain actively growing onion root tips. Fix them in an appropriate fixative (e.g., Carnoy's fluid) and then hydrolyze them in HCl.
2.  **Staining:** Stain the root tips with acetocarmine or aceto-orcein stain.
3.  **Squashing:** Place a stained root tip on a slide, add a drop of water, and gently squash it under a coverslip using the thumb, ensuring cells are spread in a single layer.
4.  **Observation:** Observe the slide under a compound microscope. Systematically scan for cells undergoing different stages of mitosis: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.
5.  **Drawing:** Draw neat, labeled diagrams of each identified mitotic stage.

## Expected Outcome
Identification and differentiation of the various stages of cell division (mitosis) in plant cells.
