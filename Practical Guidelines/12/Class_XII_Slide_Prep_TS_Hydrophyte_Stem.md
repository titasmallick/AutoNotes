# Class XII Practical: Slide Preparation - T.S. of Hydrophyte Stem

## Objective
To prepare a temporary transverse section (T.S.) of a hydrophyte (aquatic plant) stem and observe its anatomical adaptations to an aquatic environment.

## Guidelines
1.  **Specimen Selection:** Obtain a fresh stem of an aquatic plant (e.g., Hydrilla, Nymphaea, Eichhornia).
2.  **Sectioning:** Carefully cut very thin transverse sections of the stem using a sharp blade.
3.  **Staining (Optional):** Stain the sections with a dilute stain like safranin or methylene blue.
4.  **Mounting:** Mount the stained section in a drop of water on a clean glass slide and cover with a coverslip.
5.  **Observation:** Observe the slide under a compound microscope. Look for characteristic adaptations:
    *   **Reduced Vascular Tissue:** Less developed xylem and phloem.
    *   **Large Air Chambers (Aerenchyma):** Extensive air spaces for buoyancy and gas exchange.
    *   **Thin Cuticle/Absent Stomata:** Reduced need for water conservation.
    *   **Poorly Developed Mechanical Tissues:** Less need for support in water.
6.  **Drawing:** Draw a neat, labeled diagram of the observed T.S. of the hydrophyte stem, highlighting its adaptive features.

## Expected Outcome
Clear microscopic observation of anatomical features in a hydrophyte stem that facilitate survival in an aquatic habitat.
