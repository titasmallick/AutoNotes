# Class XII Practical: Slide Preparation - Germination of Pollen Grains

## Objective
To prepare a temporary mount of germinating pollen grains and observe the development of the pollen tube.

## Guidelines
1.  **Pollen Collection:** Collect fresh pollen grains from a mature flower (e.g., Hibiscus, Petunia, Balsam).
2.  **Germination Medium:** Prepare a sugar solution (e.g., 10% sucrose solution) on a clean glass slide. A drop of boric acid can be added to enhance germination.
3.  **Inoculation:** Dust the pollen grains onto the drop of sugar solution.
4.  **Incubation:** Keep the slide in a moist chamber (e.g., a petri dish with moist filter paper) for 15-30 minutes or longer, depending on the pollen type.
5.  **Observation:** Observe the slide under a compound microscope. Look for pollen grains that have developed a pollen tube emerging from the germ pore.
6.  **Drawing:** Draw neat, labeled diagrams of germinating pollen grains showing the pollen tube.

## Expected Outcome
Microscopic observation of pollen grains with elongated pollen tubes, illustrating the initial stage of fertilization in flowering plants.
