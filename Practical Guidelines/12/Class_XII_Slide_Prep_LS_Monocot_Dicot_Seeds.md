# Class XII Practical: Slide Preparation - L.S. of Monocot & Dicot Seeds

## Objective
To prepare a temporary longitudinal section (L.S.) of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous seeds and observe their internal structures.

## Guidelines
1.  **Seed Preparation:** Soak monocot (e.g., maize, rice) and dicot (e.g., pea, bean) seeds in water overnight to soften them.
2.  **Sectioning:** Carefully cut a very thin longitudinal section of each seed using a sharp blade. It's crucial to cut through the embryo.
3.  **Staining (Optional):** Stain the sections with a dilute stain like safranin or iodine (for starch in endosperm).
4.  **Mounting:** Mount the stained section in a drop of water on a clean glass slide and cover with a coverslip.
5.  **Observation:** Observe the slides under a compound microscope. Identify and compare:
    *   **Seed Coat:** Outer protective layer.
    *   **Embryo:** Radicle, plumule, cotyledon(s).
    *   **Endosperm:** Food storage tissue (present in monocots, often absent/reduced in dicots).
    *   **Hilum/Micropyle:** Scar and pore on the seed coat.
6.  **Drawing:** Draw neat, labeled diagrams of both monocot and dicot seed L.S., highlighting key differences.

## Expected Outcome
Clear microscopic observation and differentiation between the internal anatomical structures of monocot and dicot seeds, particularly the number of cotyledons and presence/absence of endosperm.
