# Class XII Practical: Slide Preparation - T.S. of Ovary (Marginal/Axile Placentation)

## Objective
To prepare a temporary transverse section (T.S.) of a flower ovary and observe different types of placentation (marginal or axile).

## Guidelines
1.  **Ovary Selection:** Obtain a fresh flower with a suitable ovary (e.g., pea flower for marginal placentation, Hibiscus or tomato for axile placentation).
2.  **Sectioning:** Carefully cut a very thin transverse section of the ovary using a sharp blade.
3.  **Staining (Optional):** Stain the section with a dilute stain like safranin.
4.  **Mounting:** Mount the stained section in a drop of water or glycerine on a clean glass slide and cover with a coverslip.
5.  **Observation:** Observe the slide under a compound microscope. Identify the ovary wall, locules (chambers), ovules, and the arrangement of ovules on the placenta.
6.  **Identification of Placentation:** Based on the arrangement, identify whether it is marginal (e.g., ovules on the ventral suture of a single carpel) or axile (e.g., ovules on the central axis in a multilocular ovary).
7.  **Drawing:** Draw a neat, labeled diagram of the observed T.S. of the ovary, highlighting the placentation type.

## Expected Outcome
Clear microscopic observation and differentiation between marginal and axile placentation types within a flower ovary.
