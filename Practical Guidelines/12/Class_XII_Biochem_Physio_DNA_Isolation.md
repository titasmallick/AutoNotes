# Class XII Practical: Biochemical & Physiological Experiments - DNA Isolation from Plant Material

## Objective
To extract and observe DNA from common plant materials like banana, spinach, pea, or papaya.

## Guidelines
1.  **Material Preparation:** Take a small amount of fresh plant material (e.g., banana pulp, spinach leaves).
2.  **Homogenization:** Mash or blend the plant material thoroughly to break open cells.
3.  **Lysis Buffer Preparation:** Prepare a lysis buffer containing detergent (e.g., dish soap) to break down cell membranes, salt (e.g., NaCl) to neutralize DNA charge, and water.
4.  **Incubation:** Mix the homogenized plant material with the lysis buffer and incubate at a warm temperature (e.g., 50-60Â°C) for a short period to aid cell lysis.
5.  **Filtration:** Filter the mixture through a cheesecloth or sieve to remove large debris.
6.  **Enzyme Treatment (Optional):** Add a protease (e.g., meat tenderizer) to digest proteins.
7.  **DNA Precipitation:** Carefully add chilled ethanol or isopropanol to the filtrate. DNA will precipitate out as white, stringy strands at the interface of the two layers.
8.  **Observation:** Spool the precipitated DNA onto a glass rod or observe it floating in the alcohol layer.

## Expected Outcome
Visible strands of DNA extracted from plant cells, demonstrating the presence of genetic material.
