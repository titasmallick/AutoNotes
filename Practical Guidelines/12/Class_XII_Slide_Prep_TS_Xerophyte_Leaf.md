# Class XII Practical: Slide Preparation - T.S. of Xerophyte Leaf (Nerium)

## Objective
To prepare a temporary transverse section (T.S.) of a xerophyte leaf (e.g., Nerium) and observe its anatomical adaptations to arid conditions.

## Guidelines
1.  **Specimen Selection:** Obtain a fresh leaf of a xerophytic plant, typically Nerium (Oleander).
2.  **Sectioning:** Carefully cut very thin transverse sections of the leaf using a sharp blade.
3.  **Staining (Optional):** Stain the sections with appropriate stains (e.g., safranin and fast green).
4.  **Mounting:** Mount the stained section in a drop of water or glycerine on a clean glass slide and cover with a coverslip.
5.  **Observation:** Observe the slide under a compound microscope. Look for characteristic adaptations:
    *   **Thick Cuticle:** A thick waxy layer on the epidermis.
    *   **Multiple Epidermis/Hypodermis:** Extra layers for protection.
    *   **Sunken Stomata:** Stomata located in pits or depressions to reduce water loss.
    *   **Hairs/Trichomes:** Presence of hairs on the epidermis, especially in stomatal pits.
    *   **Well-developed Vascular Tissue:** Efficient water transport.
    *   **Sclerenchymatous Tissues:** For mechanical support.
6.  **Drawing:** Draw a neat, labeled diagram of the observed T.S. of the xerophyte leaf, highlighting its adaptive features.

## Expected Outcome
Clear microscopic observation of anatomical features in a xerophyte leaf that facilitate water conservation and survival in dry environments.
