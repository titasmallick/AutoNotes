# Class XII Practical: Biochemical & Physiological Experiments - Soil Analysis

## Objective
To analyze soil samples from two different sites for texture, moisture content, humus content, water-holding capacity, and pH.

## Guidelines
1.  **Sample Collection:** Collect representative soil samples from two distinct sites (e.g., garden soil, roadside soil, forest soil).
2.  **Texture Analysis:**
    *   **Sedimentation Method:** Mix soil with water in a jar, allow to settle, and observe layers of sand, silt, and clay.
    *   **Feel Method:** Rub moist soil between fingers to estimate texture.
3.  **Moisture Content:** Weigh a fresh soil sample, dry it in an oven, and re-weigh to calculate percentage moisture loss.
4.  **Humus Content:** Ignite a dried soil sample in a crucible to burn off organic matter, and calculate percentage loss in weight.
5.  **Water-Holding Capacity:** Weigh a dry soil sample, saturate it with water, allow excess to drain, and re-weigh to calculate the amount of water retained.
6.  **pH Measurement:** Prepare a soil suspension and measure its pH using a pH paper/indicator or a pH meter.
7.  **Data Recording:** Record all observations and calculations in a tabular form for both soil samples.

## Expected Outcome
Comparative data on the physical and chemical properties of soil from different locations, demonstrating variations in soil composition.
