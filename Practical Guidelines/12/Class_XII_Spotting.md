# Class XII Practical: Spotting

## Objective
To identify and draw various biological specimens, slides, charts, and models, and infer their characteristics or principles.

## Guidelines
For each item presented (slide, chart, model, or specimen):
1.  **Identification:** Correctly identify the given item.
2.  **Drawing:** Make a neat, labeled diagram of the identified item. For slides, draw what is observed under the microscope. For specimens/models, draw the external features. For charts, reproduce the key information.
3.  **Observation:** Note down key observable features or structures.
4.  **Inference/Comment:** Briefly explain the biological significance, function, or classification of the item.

## Items for Spotting

### Slides/Charts/Models
*   T.S. of mammalian ovary (prepared slide/model)
*   T.S. of mammalian testis (prepared slide/model)
*   Germinating pollen grain (prepared slide/chart)
*   Types of placentation (charts/models)
*   Mammalian blastula/blastocyst (prepared slide/model/chart)
*   Plasmodium sporozoite (prepared slide)
*   Entamoeba histolytica (prepared slide)
*   Ascaris specimen (specimen/model)

### Adaptations
*   **Xeric Plants/Animals:** (Specimens/charts/models demonstrating adaptations to dry environments)
    *   *Identify:* The organism and its xeric adaptation(s).
    *   *Draw:* Labeled diagram showing the adaptation.
    *   *Observation:* Note features like thick cuticle, sunken stomata, water storage, burrowing habits, etc.
    *   *Inference:* Explain how the adaptation helps in water conservation or survival in arid conditions.
*   **Aquatic Plants/Animals:** (Specimens/charts/models demonstrating adaptations to aquatic environments)
    *   *Identify:* The organism and its aquatic adaptation(s).
    *   *Draw:* Labeled diagram showing the adaptation.
    *   *Observation:* Note features like aerenchyma, reduced roots, streamlined body, gills, webbed feet, etc.
    *   *Inference:* Explain how the adaptation helps in buoyancy, gas exchange, movement, or survival in water.

### Pollination Types
*   **Insect Pollination (Entomophily):** (Flowers/charts/models showing features for insect attraction)
    *   *Identify:* Features indicating insect pollination (e.g., large, colorful petals, nectar guides, scent, sticky pollen).
    *   *Draw:* Labeled diagram of an insect-pollinated flower.
    *   *Observation:* Note the specific adaptations.
    *   *Inference:* Explain how these features facilitate pollination by insects.
*   **Water Pollination (Hydrophily):** (Plants/charts/models showing features for water pollination)
    *   *Identify:* Features indicating water pollination (e.g., small, inconspicuous flowers, pollen released on water surface, mucilaginous covering).
    *   *Draw:* Labeled diagram of a water-pollinated plant/flower.
    *   *Observation:* Note the specific adaptations.
    *   *Inference:* Explain how these features facilitate pollination by water.
*   **Wind Pollination (Anemophily):** (Plants/charts/models showing features for wind pollination)
    *   *Identify:* Features indicating wind pollination (e.g., small, inconspicuous flowers, no scent/nectar, large feathery stigmas, abundant light pollen).
    *   *Draw:* Labeled diagram of a wind-pollinated plant/flower.
    *   *Observation:* Note the specific adaptations.
    *   *Inference:* Explain how these features facilitate pollination by wind.
