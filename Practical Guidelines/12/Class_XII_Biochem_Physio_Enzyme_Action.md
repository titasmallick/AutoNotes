# Class XII Practical: Biochemical & Physiological Experiments - Effect of Enzyme Action (Temperature & pH) on Starch Breakdown

## Objective
To investigate the effect of varying temperature and pH on the activity of an enzyme (e.g., amylase) in breaking down starch.

## Guidelines
1.  **Reagent Preparation:** Prepare starch solution, amylase solution, and buffer solutions of different pH values.
2.  **Temperature Experiment:**
    *   Set up multiple test tubes, each containing starch solution and amylase solution.
    *   Incubate these test tubes at different temperatures (e.g., 0°C, 20°C, 37°C, 60°C, 100°C) using water baths.
    *   At regular intervals, take a drop from each test tube and test for the presence of starch using iodine solution. Note the time taken for starch to disappear (endpoint).
3.  **pH Experiment:**
    *   Set up multiple test tubes, each containing starch solution, amylase solution, and a buffer solution of a specific pH (e.g., pH 4, 6, 7, 8, 10).
    *   Maintain a constant optimal temperature (e.g., 37°C).
    *   At regular intervals, test for starch presence using iodine solution and note the time taken for starch to disappear.
4.  **Data Analysis:** Plot graphs showing enzyme activity (e.g., 1/time taken for starch disappearance) against temperature and pH.

## Expected Outcome
Demonstration of optimal temperature and pH for enzyme activity, and how deviations from these conditions lead to decreased enzyme efficiency or denaturation.
