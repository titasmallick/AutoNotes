# Class XII Practical: Taxonomy - Floral Characteristics, Diagram & Formula

## Objective
To study the floral characteristics, construct the floral diagram, and write the floral formula for a representative plant from a given family.

## Guidelines
1.  **Specimen Selection:** Choose a fresh flower from one of the specified families (Malvaceae, Leguminosae â€“ Papilionaceae, Solanaceae, Liliaceae/Amaryllidaceae, Cruciferae, Compositae, Gramineae).
2.  **External Morphology:** Observe and note down external features:
    *   Type of inflorescence.
    *   Bracteate/Ebracteate, Bracteolate/Ebracteolate.
    *   Pedicellate/Sessile.
    *   Symmetry (Actinomorphic/Zygomorphic).
    *   Sexuality (Unisexual/Bisexual).
3.  **Dissection & Counting:** Carefully dissect the flower and count the number of parts in each whorl:
    *   **Calyx:** Sepals (number, aestivation, fusion).
    *   **Corolla:** Petals (number, aestivation, fusion).
    *   **Androecium:** Stamens (number, arrangement, fusion, anther attachment).
    *   **Gynoecium:** Carpels (number, fusion, ovary position, placentation).
4.  **Floral Diagram:** Draw a floral diagram representing the arrangement of floral parts in concentric circles, their relative positions, and fusion.
5.  **Floral Formula:** Write the floral formula using standard symbols to represent symmetry, sexuality, and the number and fusion of parts in each whorl.

## Expected Outcome
Ability to systematically analyze a flower, represent its structure through a floral diagram, and summarize its characteristics using a floral formula.
