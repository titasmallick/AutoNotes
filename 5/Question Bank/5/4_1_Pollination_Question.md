## SECTION C: Short Answer Questions (2 Marks Each)

1. **A stamen consists of an anther and a filament. The anther produces pollen grains containing male gametes, and the filament supports the anther to elevate it for effective pollen dispersal.**
2. **A carpel consists of stigma, style, and ovary. Stigma receives pollen, style supports stigma and allows pollen tube growth, and ovary contains ovules that develop into seeds after fertilization.**
3. **Self-pollination: Pollen from anther to stigma of the same flower (e.g., pea). Cross-pollination: Pollen transferred to another plant's flower of the same species (e.g., sunflower).**
4. **Bisexual flowers have both sex organs (e.g., hibiscus), unisexual flowers have only one (e.g., papaya). Bisexual flowers can self or cross-pollinate; unisexual flowers require cross-pollination.**
5. **Cross-pollination mixes genes from different plants, increasing genetic diversity and giving better adaptation and survival chances to the next generation.**
6. **Pollination begins with pollen release from anther, transfer to stigma by agents, pollen germinates, pollen tube grows to ovary, and fertilization occurs.**
7. **Adaptations of wind-pollinated flowers: Light, dry pollen; exposed stamens and stigmas; feathery stigmas for catching pollen. These help efficient pollen transfer by wind.**
8. **Adaptations of insect-pollinated flowers: Bright colors and strong fragrance attract insects; sticky pollen for easy transport; nectar as a reward ensures repeated visits.**
9. **Advantages: Ensures seed set in absence of pollinators, preserves parental traits. Disadvantages: Less genetic diversity, increased risk of diseases.**
10. **Advantages: Promotes genetic diversity, adaptation. Disadvantages: Depends on pollinators, energy costly.**
11. **Wind, water, insects, birds transfer pollen from one flower to another, enabling cross-pollination and gene mixing.**
12. **Pollination forms fruits and seeds, ensuring crop production and food for humans and animals.**
13. **Perfect (bisexual) flowers have both stamen and carpel; imperfect (unisexual) flowers have only one.**
14. **After pollen lands on stigma, it germinates forming a pollen tube down the style and delivers sperm to ovule.**
15. **Flowers with bright colors, nectar attract animals; light pollen and exposed stigmas suit wind pollination. Structure aligns with pollination type.**
16. **Pollination is vital for crop yields (e.g., apples via bees), honey production, fiber plant seeds, and ecosystem health.**
17. **Unisexuality prevents self-pollination, promoting genetic diversity by forcing cross-pollination.**
18. **Monoecious plants (maize) have both flower types on one plant; dioecious (papaya) have male and female flowers on separate plants.**

## SECTION D: Long Answer Questions (3 Marks Each)

1.     - *Diagram of bisexual flower:*
        - Labeled: Anther, Filament, Stigma, Style, Ovary, Ovule, Petal, Sepal.
        - Functions:
            - **Anther:** Produces pollen.
            - **Filament:** Supports anther.
            - **Stigma:** Receives pollen.
            - **Style:** Pollen tube passage.
            - **Ovary:** Contains ovules; becomes fruit.
            - **Ovule:** Becomes seed after fertilization.
            - **Petal:** Attracts pollinators.
            - **Sepal:** Protects flower bud.
    - *Pathway of pollen:* Pollen released from anther â†’ lands on stigma â†’ grows pollen tube down style â†’ enters ovule in ovary for fertilization.
2.     - **Pollination starts with pollen release from anther. Pollinators or wind transfer pollen to stigma. Pollen grain germinates and forms a tube down the style, reaching ovule. Sperm travels through the tube, merges with egg cell, forming zygote. Post-fertilization, ovule develops into seed, ovary becomes fruit.**
3.     - **Self-pollination (e.g., pea): within same flower or plant, ensures seed production but less diversity. Cross-pollination (e.g., sunflower): between different plants, increases diversity. Evolutionarily, self-pollination is stable in harsh or isolated conditions, cross-pollination gives greater adaptability.**
4.     - **Agents: wind, insects, birds, water, bats. Wind-pollinated flowers are small with light pollen; insect-pollinated are colorful and scented; bird-pollinated produce abundant nectar and vivid colors; water-pollinated plants have floating pollen. Each adaptation ensures efficient pollen transfer.**
5.     - **Pollination promotes gene mixing, species survival, and adapts plant populations to environmental changes. Pollinator decline leads to lower biodiversity, poor ecosystem stability, reduced food security, and plant extinctions.**
6.     - **Androecium (male): anther and filament, makes pollen. Gynoecium (female): stigma, style, ovary. If both are together (bisexual), enables self and cross-pollination; if separate, encourages cross-pollination.**
7.     - **Pollination is vital for food (fruits, vegetables), fibers (cotton), and survival of wild plants. Many crops (applesâ€”bees, riceâ€”wind) depend on specific types. Both ecological and human economies rely on it.**
8.     - **Pollination syndrome describes floral traits for pollinator type: windâ€”small, no nectar; insectsâ€”bright, sweet; birdsâ€”tubular, red, nectar. Each advancement matches the pollinator's ability.**
9.     - **Bisexual flowers are efficient in self-pollination but less diverse, ideal for stable habitats. Unisexual prevent selfing, force cross-pollination, increasing diversity, and suit dynamic environments.**
10.     - **Flowers and pollinators mutually adapt (co-evolve): bees fit into tubular flowers; birds like trumpet-shaped, red flowers; figs with specific wasps. Such specialization improves pollination success but increases dependency.**
11.     - **Artificial pollination is done by humans using tools to transfer pollen, essential in controlled breeding, improving crops/hybrids, or when natural pollinators are absent. Used in producing seedless fruits and hybrid crops.**
12.     - **Pollination success depends on flower structure, pollinator availability, weather, and timing. Extreme weather or habitat loss can disrupt, lowering seed/fruit set.**
13.     - **Scientists examine petal color, pollen type, scent, flower shape to predict pollination method: e.g., flat, scented attracts bees, large exposed stigmas fit wind pollination.**
14.     - **Timing is crucial: anther releases pollen (dehiscence); stigma is ready (receptivity); pollinators are active. Coordinated timing ensures pollination is effective.**
15.     - **Pollination biology aids conservation efforts; understanding plant-pollinator relationships helps protect endangered species and maintain ecosystems.**
