## Key Concepts

### Sexual Reproduction and Fertilization

*   **Sexual Reproduction:** Involves the fusion of male and female gametes (sex cells) to form a new individual. In flowering plants, this occurs through pollination and fertilization.
*   **Fertilization:** The process where the male gamete (from pollen) fuses with the female gamete (in the ovule) to form a zygote, which develops into a seed.

### Vegetative Reproduction

Vegetative reproduction (or vegetative propagation) is a form of asexual reproduction in plants, where new plants grow from vegetative parts of the parent plant, such as stems, roots, or leaves, without the involvement of seeds or spores.

*   **Stem:**
    *   **Potato:** New potato plants can grow from the 'eyes' (buds) on a potato tuber (modified stem).
    *   **Onion:** New onion plants can grow from the bulb (modified stem) of an onion.
*   **Root:**
    *   **Carrot:** New carrot plants can grow from the top part of a carrot root if planted in suitable conditions.
*   **Leaf:**
    *   **Bryophyllum (Mother of Thousands):** Its leaves have special buds along their margins. When these leaves fall on moist soil, these buds develop into new plantlets.

### Seed Dispersal Methods

Seed dispersal is the movement or transport of seeds away from the parent plant. This is important to prevent overcrowding and competition for resources.

*   **Air (Wind Dispersal):**
    *   **Characteristics:** Seeds are usually light, small, or have wing-like or hair-like structures to catch the wind.
    *   **Examples:** Dandelion (parachute-like hairs), Maple (winged seeds), Cotton (fluffy seeds).
*   **Water (Water Dispersal):**
    *   **Characteristics:** Seeds are buoyant and have fibrous or spongy outer coverings that allow them to float on water.
    *   **Examples:** Coconut (fibrous husk), Lotus (spongy fruit).
*   **Animals (Animal Dispersal):**
    *   **Characteristics:** Seeds can be dispersed by animals in several ways:
        *   **Fleshy Fruits:** Animals eat the fruit, and the seeds pass through their digestive system unharmed and are deposited with feces (e.g., Mango, Cherry).
        *   **Hooks/Spines:** Seeds have hooks, barbs, or sticky surfaces that attach to animal fur or feathers and are carried away (e.g., Xanthium, Burdock).
        *   **Burial:** Animals (like squirrels) bury seeds for later consumption but forget some, allowing them to germinate.

### Importance of Seed Dispersal

*   **Prevents Overcrowding:** Ensures that new plants do not grow too close to the parent plant, reducing competition for sunlight, water, and nutrients.
*   **Colonization of New Areas:** Allows plants to spread to new habitats, increasing their chances of survival and expanding their range.
*   **Reduces Disease Spread:** Spreading seeds out can reduce the likelihood of diseases affecting an entire population.
*   **Genetic Diversity:** Helps in cross-pollination and genetic mixing, leading to stronger and more adaptable plant populations.

## Activities (for understanding, not part of notes)

*   Draw reproductive parts of a flower.
*   Visit a nursery or school garden to observe different plant reproduction methods.
*   Collect seeds and classify them by their dispersal method.
*   Conduct simple germination experiments.
*   Work on a project on vegetative propagation.
