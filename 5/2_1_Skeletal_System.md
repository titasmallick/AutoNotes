# Human Body â€“ The Skeletal System

## Key Concepts

### Major Bones

The skeletal system provides the framework of the body, gives it shape, supports it, and protects internal organs. It also allows for movement.

*   **Arms:** Humerus (upper arm), Radius and Ulna (forearm).
*   **Legs:** Femur (thigh bone - longest bone), Tibia and Fibula (lower leg).
*   **Skull:** Protects the brain.
*   **Jawbone (Mandible):** The only movable bone in the skull, used for chewing.
*   **Backbone (Vertebral Column):** A series of small bones (vertebrae) that protect the spinal cord and support the body.
*   **Chest Bone (Sternum) and Ribs:** The ribs form a cage around the chest, protecting the heart and lungs. The sternum is the flat bone in the center of the chest to which the ribs are attached.

### Types of Joints

Joints are places where two or more bones meet, allowing movement.

*   **Shoulder Joint:** A ball-and-socket joint, allowing movement in many directions (e.g., rotating the arm).
*   **Knee Joint:** A hinge joint, allowing movement in one plane (e.g., bending and straightening the leg).
*   **Elbow Joint:** Also a hinge joint, allowing bending and straightening of the arm.

### Functions of Bones and Joints

*   **Bones:**
    *   **Support:** Provide a rigid framework for the body.
    *   **Protection:** Protect delicate internal organs (e.g., skull protects the brain, rib cage protects heart and lungs).
    *   **Movement:** Act as levers, allowing muscles to pull on them to produce movement.
    *   **Storage:** Store minerals like calcium and phosphorus.
    *   **Blood Cell Production:** Bone marrow (inside some bones) produces blood cells.
*   **Joints:** Allow movement between bones.

### Importance of Good Posture

Good posture means holding your body in a way that puts the least strain on your muscles and ligaments. It is important for:

*   **Spinal Health:** Prevents back pain and spinal problems.
*   **Breathing:** Allows the lungs to expand fully.
*   **Digestion:** Helps internal organs function properly.
*   **Appearance:** Makes you look taller and more confident.

### Role of Calcium-Rich Foods

Calcium is a vital mineral for strong and healthy bones and teeth. Calcium-rich foods include:

*   Milk and dairy products (yogurt, cheese)
*   Green leafy vegetables (spinach, broccoli)
*   Fortified cereals and juices
*   Tofu

### Exercises to Strengthen Bones and Muscles

*   **Weight-bearing exercises:** Activities like walking, running, jumping, and dancing help build and maintain bone density.
*   **Strength training:** Exercises using weights or body weight (e.g., push-ups, squats) strengthen muscles, which in turn support and protect bones.

## Activities (for understanding, not part of notes)

*   Draw major bones and joints.
*   Observe skeleton models/charts.
*   Perform posture exercises.
*   Identify calcium-rich foods.
