# Human Body â€“ The Circulatory System

## Key Concepts

### Organs of the Circulatory System

The circulatory system is responsible for transporting blood, nutrients, oxygen, and waste products throughout the body. Its main organs are:

*   **Heart:** A muscular organ located in the chest, slightly to the left. It acts as a pump, pushing blood through the blood vessels.
*   **Arteries:** Blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood *away* from the heart to different parts of the body.
*   **Veins:** Blood vessels that carry oxygen-poor blood *back* to the heart from different parts of the body.

### Functions of Blood and Different Organs

*   **Blood:**
    *   Transports oxygen from the lungs to all body cells.
    *   Carries nutrients from digested food to the cells.
    *   Collects waste products (like carbon dioxide) from cells to be removed from the body.
    *   Helps fight infections and diseases.
    *   Helps regulate body temperature.
*   **Heart:** Pumps blood continuously throughout the body.
*   **Arteries:** Distribute oxygenated blood to the body.
*   **Veins:** Collect deoxygenated blood and return it to the heart.

### Process of Blood Circulation (Basic)

1.  The heart pumps oxygen-poor blood to the lungs.
2.  In the lungs, blood picks up oxygen and releases carbon dioxide.
3.  Oxygen-rich blood returns to the heart.
4.  The heart then pumps this oxygen-rich blood to all parts of the body through arteries.
5.  Blood delivers oxygen and nutrients to cells and collects waste products.
6.  Oxygen-poor blood returns to the heart through veins, completing the cycle.

### Differences between Arteries and Veins

| Feature | Arteries | Veins |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Direction of Blood Flow** | Away from the heart | Towards the heart |
| **Oxygen Content** | Mostly oxygen-rich (except pulmonary artery) | Mostly oxygen-poor (except pulmonary vein) |
| **Wall Thickness** | Thick, muscular, elastic | Thin, less muscular, less elastic |
| **Valves** | Absent (except at heart exit) | Present (to prevent backflow) |
| **Blood Pressure** | High | Low |

### Keeping the Heart Healthy through Simple Exercises and Yoga

*   **Regular Exercise:** Activities like walking, running, cycling, and swimming strengthen the heart muscle, improve blood circulation, and help maintain a healthy weight.
*   **Yoga and Pranayama (Deep Breathing):** These practices help reduce stress, lower blood pressure, improve lung capacity, and promote overall cardiovascular health.

## Activities (for understanding, not part of notes)

*   Draw and label circulatory organs (heart, arteries, veins).
*   Observe models and charts of the circulatory system.
*   Discuss ways to stay healthy and protect the heart.
*   Practice deep breathing exercises or pranayama.
