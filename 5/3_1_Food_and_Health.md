## Key Concepts

### Components of a Balanced Diet

A balanced diet is one that provides all the essential nutrients in the right amounts to maintain good health, growth, and proper functioning of the body. The main components are:

*   **Carbohydrates:** Provide energy (e.g., rice, wheat, potatoes, bread).
*   **Fats:** Provide concentrated energy, insulation, and protect organs (e.g., butter, oil, nuts).
*   **Proteins:** Essential for growth, repair of tissues, and building muscles (e.g., pulses, eggs, meat, fish).
*   **Vitamins:** Needed in small amounts for various body functions and to prevent diseases (e.g., fruits, vegetables).
*   **Minerals:** Essential for strong bones, teeth, blood formation, and other body processes (e.g., milk, green leafy vegetables, salt).
*   **Water:** Essential for all bodily functions, transports nutrients, and regulates body temperature.
*   **Roughage (Fibre):** Helps in digestion and prevents constipation (e.g., whole grains, fruits, vegetables).

### Deficiency Diseases

These are diseases caused by a lack of specific nutrients in the diet over a long period.

*   **Kwashiorkor:** Caused by severe protein deficiency.
    *   **Symptoms:** Swelling (edema), stunted growth, changes in hair and skin, pot belly.
*   **Marasmus:** Caused by severe deficiency of protein and calories.
    *   **Symptoms:** Severe wasting of muscles and fat, very thin body, stunted growth.
*   **Night Blindness:** Caused by Vitamin A deficiency.
    *   **Symptoms:** Difficulty seeing in dim light or at night.
*   **Anaemia:** Caused by Iron deficiency.
    *   **Symptoms:** Weakness, fatigue, pale skin, shortness of breath.
*   **Rickets:** Caused by Vitamin D deficiency.
    *   **Symptoms:** Soft and weak bones, bowed legs, delayed growth.
*   **Scurvy:** Caused by Vitamin C deficiency.
    *   **Symptoms:** Bleeding gums, fatigue, joint pain, poor wound healing.
*   **Beriberi:** Caused by Vitamin B1 (Thiamine) deficiency.
    *   **Symptoms:** Weakness, nerve damage, heart problems.
*   **Goitre:** Caused by Iodine deficiency.
    *   **Symptoms:** Swelling of the thyroid gland in the neck.

### Lifestyle Diseases

These diseases are often linked to a person's lifestyle choices and habits.

*   **Obesity:** Excessive accumulation of body fat, often due to overeating and lack of physical activity.
    *   **Symptoms:** High body mass index (BMI), increased risk of other health problems.
*   **Diabetes:** A condition where the body cannot properly regulate blood sugar levels, either due to insufficient insulin production or the body's inability to use insulin effectively.
    *   **Symptoms:** Frequent urination, increased thirst, unexplained weight loss, fatigue.
*   **Blood Pressure (Hypertension):** Persistently high force of blood against the artery walls.
    *   **Symptoms:** Often no symptoms (silent killer), but can lead to headaches, dizziness, and serious heart problems if untreated.

### Harmful Effects of Junk Food

Junk food is typically high in calories, unhealthy fats, sugar, and salt, but low in essential nutrients.

*   **Weight Gain and Obesity:** High calorie content leads to excess fat storage.
*   **Nutrient Deficiency:** Lacks vitamins, minerals, and fiber, leading to poor health.
*   **Increased Risk of Lifestyle Diseases:** Contributes to diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure.
*   **Digestive Problems:** Low fiber content can lead to constipation.
*   **Dental Problems:** High sugar content can cause tooth decay.

### Benefits of Sprouted/Fermented Foods

*   **Sprouted Foods (e.g., sprouted moong, chana):**
    *   **Benefits:** Increased nutrient content (vitamins, minerals), easier to digest, improved absorption of nutrients.
*   **Fermented Foods (e.g., yogurt, idli, dosa):**
    *   **Benefits:** Rich in probiotics (beneficial bacteria) that improve gut health, enhance nutrient absorption, and boost immunity.

### Food Adulteration (Basic Awareness)

Food adulteration is the act of intentionally debasing the quality of food by adding inferior or harmful substances, or by removing valuable ingredients. It is illegal and harmful.

*   **Examples:** Adding water to milk, mixing stones in rice, adding artificial colors to spices, using harmful chemicals to ripen fruits.
*   **Harm:** Can cause health problems, from mild digestive issues to severe poisoning and long-term diseases.

## Activities (for understanding, not part of notes)

*   Classify healthy vs. junk food.
*   Create food and nutrient charts.
*   Talk with health professionals about diet.
*   Conduct surveys on diet and health habits.
