**SECTION B (Brief Answers)**

**Question 3**

(ii) (a) Arteries have thick, muscular walls; veins have thin walls. (b) Arteries do not have valves (except at the base of the aorta and pulmonary artery); veins have valves to prevent backflow of blood.
(iii) High birth rate and low death rate.
(iv) It insulates the axon and allows for saltatory conduction, which greatly increases the speed of nerve impulse transmission.
(v) Diagram of a nephron should include Bowman's capsule, glomerulus, PCT, Loop of Henle, DCT, and collecting duct.

**Question 4**
(i) The neural pathway that mediates a reflex action, typically including a receptor, sensory neuron, interneuron, motor neuron, and effector.
(ii) Biodegradable wastes can be decomposed by microorganisms (e.g., paper), while non-biodegradable wastes cannot (e.g., plastic).
(iii) During gamete formation, the two alleles for a heritable character separate from each other, so that each gamete ends up with only one allele for that character.
(iv) It cushions and protects the fetus from mechanical shock and maintains a constant temperature.
(v) The "fight or flight" response is triggered by the hormone adrenaline from the adrenal medulla. It increases heart rate, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels, preparing the body for emergency situations.

**Question 5**
(i) The blood passes through the heart twice for each complete circuit of the body (pulmonary and systemic circulation).
(ii) To eliminate open defecation and to implement modern and scientific municipal solid waste management.
(iii) (a) Insulin lowers blood glucose levels. (b) Glucagon raises blood glucose levels.
(iv) The process by which the eye changes the shape of its lens (using ciliary muscles) to focus on objects at different distances.
(v) Diagram of a chromosome should show two sister chromatids joined at a centromere.

**Question 6**
(i) A neuron will fire an action potential with the same intensity once the stimulus threshold is reached, regardless of the strength of the stimulus above the threshold.
(ii) Identical twins develop from one fertilized egg that splits, so they are genetically identical. Fraternal twins develop from two separate eggs fertilized by two different sperm, so they are genetically like siblings.
(iii) (a) Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (b) Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone
(iv) It provides nutrition, facilitates gas exchange, removes waste, and produces hormones to maintain the pregnancy.
(v) In light, K+ ions are pumped into guard cells, lowering their water potential. Water enters by osmosis, making the cells turgid and opening the stoma. In darkness, K+ ions leave, water exits, and the guard cells become flaccid, closing the stoma.

**Question 7**
(i) The number of live births per thousand people in a population in a given year.
(ii) Phototropism is the growth response to light, while geotropism is the growth response to gravity.
(iii) Increased UV radiation reaching Earth, which can cause skin cancer, cataracts, and damage to ecosystems.
(iv) Auxins produced by the apical bud inhibit the growth of lateral buds, causing the plant to grow taller with a single main stem.
(v) Diagram of the human heart should show the four chambers, major blood vessels, and valves.

**Question 8**
(i) To coordinate voluntary muscle movements, posture, and balance.
(ii) Larger cranial capacity than *Homo habilis* and was efficiently bipedal.
(iii) Because their red blood cells have no A or B antigens, so their blood can be transfused to people with any blood type without causing an immune reaction.
(iv) It is the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes, which creates new combinations of alleles and increases genetic variation.
(v) (a) High pressure forces water and small solutes from the blood into Bowman's capsule. (b) Essential substances like glucose, water, and ions are reabsorbed from the filtrate back into the blood. (c) Waste products and excess ions are actively transported from the blood into the filtrate.
