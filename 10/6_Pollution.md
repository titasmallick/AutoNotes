# Pollution

Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change.

## Types and Sources

*   **Air Pollution:** The contamination of air by smoke and harmful gases, mainly oxides of carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen.
*   **Water Pollution:** The contamination of water bodies, usually as a result of human activities.
*   **Soil Pollution:** The contamination of soil with harmful substances.
*   **Thermal Pollution:** The degradation of water quality by any process that changes ambient water temperature.
*   **Radiation Pollution:** The release of radioactive substances into the environment.
*   **Biomedical Waste:** Waste generated during the diagnosis, treatment, or immunization of human beings or animals.
*   **Noise Pollution:** The disturbing or excessive noise that may harm the activity or balance of human or animal life.

## Waste

*   **Biodegradable:** Waste that can be broken down by microorganisms.
    *   **Examples:** Paper, peel
*   **Non-biodegradable:** Waste that cannot be broken down by microorganisms.
    *   **Examples:** Plastic, glass, DDT

## Effects and Control

*   **Global Warming:** The long-term heating of Earth’s climate system observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth’s atmosphere.
*   **Acid Rain:** Rain or any other form of precipitation that is unusually acidic, meaning that it has elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low pH).
*   **Ozone Depletion:** The thinning of the ozone layer in the Earth's stratosphere.

## Control Measures

*   **CNG (Compressed Natural Gas):** A fuel gas which is a cleaner alternative to gasoline, diesel fuel and propane/LPG.
*   **Afforestation:** The process of planting trees.
*   **Sewage Treatment:** The process of removing contaminants from wastewater.
*   **Plastic Bans:** The prohibition of the use of plastic.
*   **Organic Farming:** A method of crop and livestock production that involves much more than choosing not to use pesticides, fertilizers, genetically modified organisms, antibiotics and growth hormones.
*   **Euro Bharat Norms:** Emission standards for vehicles.

## Mention

*   **Swachh Bharat Abhiyan:** A country-wide campaign initiated by the Government of India in 2014 to eliminate open defecation and improve solid waste management.
