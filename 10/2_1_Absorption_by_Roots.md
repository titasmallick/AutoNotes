# Absorption by Roots

The process by which plants absorb water and minerals from the soil through their roots.

## Processes

*   **Imbibition:** The phenomenon of absorption of water by the solid particles of a substance without forming a solution. Example: swelling of seeds when soaked in water.
*   **Diffusion:** The net movement of molecules or atoms from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration.
*   **Osmosis:** The spontaneous net movement of solvent molecules through a selectively permeable membrane into a region of higher solute concentration, in the direction that tends to equalize the solute concentrations on the two sides.

## Key Terms

*   **Osmotic Pressure:** The minimum pressure which needs to be applied to a solution to prevent the inward flow of its pure solvent across a semipermeable membrane.
*   **Root Pressure:** The transverse osmotic pressure within the cells of a root system that causes sap to rise through a plant stem to the leaves.
*   **Turgidity:** The state of a plant cell in which the cell wall is rigid and stretched by an increase in the volume of vacuoles due to the absorption of water.
*   **Plasmolysis:** The process in which cells lose water in a hypertonic solution.
*   **Flaccidity:** The condition of a plant cell in which the plasma membrane is not pressed against the cell wall.

## Transport

*   **Active Transport:** The movement of ions or molecules across a cell membrane into a region of higher concentration, assisted by enzymes and requiring energy.
*   **Passive Transport:** The movement of ions and other atomic or molecular substances across cell membranes without need of energy input.

## Ascent of Sap

The upward movement of water from the roots to the aerial parts of the plant.

*   **Cohesion:** The sticking together of alike molecules, such as water molecule being attracted to another water molecule.
*   **Adhesion:** The tendency of dissimilar particles or surfaces to cling to one another.
*   **Transpiration Pull:** The force that pulls water up from the roots through the xylem to the leaves.
