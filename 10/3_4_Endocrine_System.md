# Endocrine System

The endocrine system is a chemical messenger system comprising feedback loops of the hormones released by internal glands of an organism directly into the circulatory system, regulating distant target organs.

## Endocrine vs. Exocrine Glands

*   **Endocrine Glands:** Ductless glands that secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream.
*   **Exocrine Glands:** Glands that secrete their products into ducts that lead to the target organ.

## Glands and Hormones

*   **Pancreas:**
    *   **Insulin:** Lowers blood glucose levels.
    *   **Glucagon:** Raises blood glucose levels.
*   **Thyroid:**
    *   **Thyroxine:** Regulates metabolism.
*   **Adrenal:**
    *   **Cortical Hormones:** Regulate metabolism and stress response.
    *   **Adrenaline:** Prepares the body for 'fight or flight' response.
*   **Pituitary:**
    *   **Growth Hormone:** Stimulates growth.
    *   **Tropic Hormones:** Control the function of other endocrine glands.
    *   **Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH):** Regulates water balance.
    *   **Oxytocin:** Stimulates uterine contractions and milk letdown.

## Disorders

*   **Hyposecretion:** Underproduction of a hormone.
*   **Hypersecretion:** Overproduction of a hormone.

## Feedback Mechanism

A feedback mechanism is a process that uses the level of a hormone to control its own production. For example, the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is controlled by the level of thyroxine in the blood.
