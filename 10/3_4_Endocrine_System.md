# The Endocrine System

The endocrine system is a complex network of glands that produce and secrete hormones, which are chemical messengers that regulate various bodily functions. These hormones travel through the bloodstream to target cells and organs, controlling processes like growth, metabolism, and reproduction.

## Endocrine vs. Exocrine Glands

| Feature | Endocrine Glands | Exocrine Glands |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ducts** | Ductless; secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream. | Have ducts to carry secretions to a specific location. |
| **Secretions** | Hormones | Enzymes, sweat, saliva, etc. |
| **Target** | Act on distant target cells or organs. | Act locally at the site of secretion. |
| **Examples** | Pituitary, thyroid, adrenal glands | Salivary, sweat, and sebaceous glands |

## Major Endocrine Glands

### 1. Adrenal Gland

*   **Location:** A pair of pyramid-shaped glands located on top of each kidney.
*   **Hormones Secreted:**
    *   **Adrenal Cortex (Outer Part):**
        *   **Cortical Hormones (Corticosteroids):**
            *   **Glucocorticoids (e.g., Cortisol):** Regulate metabolism, suppress inflammation, and help the body respond to stress.
            *   **Mineralocorticoids (e.g., Aldosterone):** Control the balance of water and salts in the body.
    *   **Adrenal Medulla (Inner Part):**
        *   **Adrenaline (Epinephrine) and Noradrenaline (Norepinephrine):** Responsible for the "fight or flight" response, increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and glucose levels.

### 2. Pancreas

*   **Location:** A long, flat gland located behind the stomach.
*   **Hormones Secreted (from the Islets of Langerhans):**
    *   **Insulin:** Lowers blood glucose levels by promoting the uptake of glucose by cells.
    *   **Glucagon:** Raises blood glucose levels by stimulating the liver to release stored glucose.

### 3. Thyroid Gland

*   **Location:** A butterfly-shaped gland located in the neck, in front of the trachea.
*   **Hormones Secreted:**
    *   **Thyroxine (T4):** The main hormone produced by the thyroid. It regulates the body's metabolic rate.

### 4. Pituitary Gland

*   **Location:** A pea-sized gland located at the base of the brain.
*   **Hormones Secreted:**
    *   **Anterior Pituitary:**
        *   **Growth Hormone (GH):** Stimulates growth, cell reproduction, and regeneration.
        *   **Tropic Hormones:** Hormones that control the function of other endocrine glands.
            *   **Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH):** Stimulates the thyroid gland.
            *   **Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH):** Stimulates the adrenal cortex.
    *   **Posterior Pituitary:**
        *   **Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH):** Regulates water balance by controlling the reabsorption of water by the kidneys.
        *   **Oxytocin:** Stimulates uterine contractions during childbirth and the release of milk during breastfeeding.

## Hormonal Imbalances

| Gland | Hormone | Hyposecretion (Too Little) | Hypersecretion (Too Much) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pancreas** | Insulin | **Hyperglycemia (Diabetes Mellitus):** High blood sugar. | **Hypoglycemia:** Low blood sugar. |
| **Thyroid** | Thyroxine | **Hypothyroidism:** Slow metabolism, weight gain, fatigue. | **Hyperthyroidism:** Rapid metabolism, weight loss, nervousness. |
| **Adrenal** | Cortisol | **Addison's Disease:** Fatigue, muscle weakness, weight loss. | **Cushing's Syndrome:** Weight gain, high blood pressure, mood swings. |
| **Pituitary** | Growth Hormone | **Dwarfism** in children. | **Gigantism** in children; **Acromegaly** in adults. |

## Feedback Mechanism: TSH

The endocrine system is regulated by feedback mechanisms to maintain homeostasis. A key example is the regulation of thyroid hormones.

1.  The **hypothalamus** releases Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone (TRH).
2.  TRH stimulates the **pituitary gland** to release Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH).
3.  TSH stimulates the **thyroid gland** to produce and release thyroxine.
4.  As thyroxine levels in the blood rise, they inhibit the release of TRH and TSH, thus reducing the production of thyroxine. This is a **negative feedback loop** that ensures the levels of thyroxine are kept within a narrow, stable range.
