# Reproductive System

The reproductive system is a system of sex organs within an organism which work together for the purpose of sexual reproduction.

## Male Reproductive Organs

*   **Testes:** Produce sperm and testosterone.
*   **Scrotum:** A sac of skin that holds the testes.
*   **Epididymis:** A long, coiled tube that stores sperm.
*   **Vas Deferens:** A tube that carries sperm from the epididymis to the urethra.
*   **Urethra:** A tube that carries both urine and sperm out of the body.
*   **Penis:** The male organ of copulation.

## Female Reproductive Organs

*   **Ovaries:** Produce eggs and estrogen.
*   **Fallopian Tubes:** Tubes that carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus.
*   **Uterus:** A muscular organ where a fertilized egg implants and develops.
*   **Cervix:** The lower part of the uterus.
*   **Vagina:** A muscular tube that connects the cervix to the outside of the body.

## Gametes

*   **Sperm:** The male gamete.
*   **Egg:** The female gamete.

## Reproduction

*   **Fertilization:** The fusion of a sperm and an egg.
*   **Implantation:** The attachment of a fertilized egg to the wall of the uterus.
*   **Placenta:** An organ that develops in the uterus during pregnancy and provides oxygen and nutrients to the fetus.
*   **Gestation:** The period of development of the fetus in the uterus.
*   **Parturition:** The process of childbirth.

## Foetal Membranes

*   **Amnion:** A membrane that surrounds the fetus and contains amniotic fluid.
*   **Chorion:** A membrane that surrounds the amnion and contributes to the formation of the placenta.
*   **Amniotic Fluid:** A fluid that surrounds the fetus and protects it from injury.

## Menstrual Cycle

The menstrual cycle is a series of changes a woman's body goes through each month in preparation for the possibility of pregnancy.

## Hormones

*   **Testosterone:** The male sex hormone.
*   **Estrogen:** The female sex hormone.
*   **Progesterone:** A female sex hormone that prepares the uterus for pregnancy.

## Twins

*   **Identical Twins:** Develop from a single fertilized egg that splits in two.
*   **Fraternal Twins:** Develop from two separate eggs that are fertilized by two different sperm.
