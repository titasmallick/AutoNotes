# The Reproductive System

The human reproductive system is responsible for the production of offspring. It consists of a set of organs that work together to produce gametes (sex cells), facilitate fertilization, and in females, to nurture and develop the embryo and fetus.

## Male Reproductive System

### Organs and Functions

*   **Testes:** The primary male reproductive organs, responsible for producing sperm and the male sex hormone, testosterone.
*   **Scrotum:** A sac of skin that holds the testes outside the body, maintaining a slightly lower temperature than the body, which is optimal for sperm production.
*   **Epididymis:** A long, coiled tube where sperm mature and are stored.
*   **Vas Deferens:** A tube that transports sperm from the epididymis to the urethra.
*   **Urethra:** A tube that extends from the bladder through the penis, carrying both urine and semen out of the body.
*   **Penis:** The external male reproductive organ, used for sexual intercourse.

### Male Accessory Glands

*   **Seminal Vesicles:** Glands that produce a fluid rich in fructose, which provides energy for the sperm.
*   **Prostate Gland:** A gland that secretes a milky, alkaline fluid that helps to neutralize the acidity of the female reproductive tract.
*   **Bulbourethral Glands (Cowper's Glands):** Glands that secrete a clear fluid that lubricates the urethra and neutralizes any residual acidity.

### Hormonal Control of Spermatogenesis

1.  The **hypothalamus** releases **Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH)**.
2.  GnRH stimulates the **anterior pituitary** to release **Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)** and **Luteinizing Hormone (LH)**.
3.  **LH** stimulates the **Leydig cells** in the testes to produce **testosterone**.
4.  **FSH** stimulates the **Sertoli cells** in the seminiferous tubules to nourish the developing sperm cells and to produce **Androgen-Binding Protein (ABP)** and **inhibin**.
5.  **ABP** binds to testosterone, keeping its concentration high within the seminiferous tubules, which is essential for spermatogenesis.
6.  **Inhibin** provides negative feedback to the pituitary, inhibiting the release of FSH.
7.  **Testosterone** provides negative feedback to both the hypothalamus and the pituitary, inhibiting the release of GnRH, LH, and FSH.

## Female Reproductive System

### Organs and Functions

*   **Ovaries:** The primary female reproductive organs, which produce eggs (ova) and the female sex hormones, estrogen and progesterone.
*   **Fallopian Tubes (Oviducts):** Tubes that transport the egg from the ovary to the uterus. Fertilization usually occurs here.
*   **Uterus:** A muscular organ where the fertilized egg implants and the fetus develops.
*   **Cervix:** The lower, narrow part of the uterus that opens into the vagina.
*   **Vagina:** A muscular tube that connects the cervix to the outside of the body. It receives sperm during intercourse and serves as the birth canal.

## Gametes: Sperm and Egg

| Feature | Sperm | Egg (Ovum) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Size** | Microscopic | Largest cell in the human body |
| **Motility** | Motile (has a tail) | Non-motile |
| **Structure** | Head (contains nucleus), midpiece (contains mitochondria), tail (for movement) | Round, with a nucleus, cytoplasm, and a protective outer layer (zona pellucida) |

## Key Processes in Reproduction

*   **Spermatogenesis:** The process of sperm production in the testes.
*   **Oogenesis:** The process of egg production in the ovaries.
*   **Fertilization:** The fusion of a sperm and an egg to form a zygote.
*   **Implantation:** The attachment of the fertilized egg (blastocyst) to the uterine wall.
*   **Gestation:** The period of pregnancy, from fertilization to birth.
*   **Parturition:** The process of childbirth.

## The Menstrual Cycle

The menstrual cycle is a series of changes a woman's body goes through each month in preparation for the possibility of pregnancy. It is controlled by a complex interplay of hormones.

### Hormonal Control of the Menstrual Cycle

1.  **Follicular Phase:**
    *   The **hypothalamus** releases **GnRH**.
    *   GnRH stimulates the **pituitary** to release **FSH** and **LH**.
    *   **FSH** stimulates the growth of ovarian follicles.
    *   The developing follicles produce **estrogen**, which causes the uterine lining (endometrium) to thicken.
2.  **Ovulation:**
    *   A surge in **LH** triggers the release of a mature egg from the ovary.
3.  **Luteal Phase:**
    *   The ruptured follicle develops into the **corpus luteum**, which produces **progesterone** and some estrogen.
    *   **Progesterone** further prepares the uterus for implantation.
4.  **Menstruation:**
    *   If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates, and progesterone and estrogen levels drop.
    *   The uterine lining is shed, resulting in menstruation.

## Pregnancy and Development

### The Placenta

The placenta is a temporary organ that connects the developing fetus to the uterine wall. Its functions include:

*   **Nutrition:** Transfers nutrients from the mother to the fetus.
*   **Respiration:** Facilitates the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.
*   **Excretion:** Removes waste products from the fetus.
*   **Endocrine Function:** Produces hormones like hCG, estrogen, and progesterone to maintain the pregnancy.

### Fetal Membranes and Amniotic Fluid

*   **Amnion:** A membrane that surrounds the fetus, creating the amniotic sac.
*   **Amniotic Fluid:** The fluid within the amniotic sac that cushions and protects the fetus.

## Twins

*   **Identical (Monozygotic) Twins:** Develop from a single fertilized egg that splits into two. They are genetically identical and of the same sex.
*   **Fraternal (Dizygotic) Twins:** Develop from two separate eggs that are fertilized by two different sperm. They are no more genetically similar than siblings and can be of the same or different sexes.
