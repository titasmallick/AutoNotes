# Circulatory System

The circulatory system is responsible for transporting nutrients, oxygen, carbon dioxide, hormones, and blood cells to and from the cells in the body to provide nourishment and help in fighting diseases, stabilize temperature and pH, and maintain homeostasis.

## Blood

*   **Red Blood Cells (RBCs):** Carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.
*   **White Blood Cells (WBCs):** Part of the immune system and help fight infection.
*   **Platelets:** Help in blood clotting.
*   **Plasma:** The liquid component of blood, which carries blood cells, nutrients, and hormones.

## Lymphatic System

*   **Lymph:** A clear fluid that contains white blood cells and circulates throughout the lymphatic system.
*   **Spleen:** An organ that filters blood and stores white blood cells.
*   **Tonsils:** A pair of soft tissue masses located at the rear of the throat that are part of the immune system.

## Heart

*   **Structure:** The heart has four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. The right side of the heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs, and the left side pumps oxygenated blood to the rest of the body.
*   **Working:** The heart contracts and relaxes to pump blood. The cardiac cycle is the sequence of events that occurs when the heart beats.
*   **Blood Vessels:** Arteries carry blood away from the heart, veins carry blood to the heart, and capillaries are tiny vessels that connect arteries and veins.

## Key Concepts

*   **Pulse:** The rhythmic expansion and recoil of arteries resulting from heart contraction.
*   **Blood Pressure (BP):** The pressure of the blood in the circulatory system.
*   **Double Circulation:** A circulatory system in which the blood travels twice through the heart for each complete circuit of the body.

## Blood Groups

*   **ABO Blood Group System:** A system used to classify human blood based on the presence or absence of A and B antigens on the surface of red blood cells.
*   **Rh Factor:** An antigen on the surface of red blood cells. People are either Rh-positive or Rh-negative.
*   **Hepatic Portal System:** A system of veins that directs blood from the gastrointestinal tract to the liver.
