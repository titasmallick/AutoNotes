# Population

Population refers to the total number of individuals of a species living in a particular geographical area at a specific time. The study of human populations is called demography.

## Population Explosion in India

Population explosion refers to the rapid increase in the population of an area. India has experienced a significant population explosion since the mid-20th century.

### Reasons for Population Explosion

*   **High Birth Rate:** Due to factors like early marriage, lack of awareness about family planning, and a preference for male children.
*   **Low Death Rate:** Due to advancements in medical science, better sanitation, and control of epidemics, the death rate has declined significantly.
*   **Poverty and Illiteracy:** Lack of education and awareness often leads to larger family sizes.

## Key Demographic Terms

*   **Demography:** The statistical study of human populations, including their size, structure, and distribution.
*   **Population Density:** The number of individuals per unit of geographical area (e.g., per square kilometer).
*   **Birth Rate (Natality):** The number of live births per thousand people in a population in a given year.
*   **Death Rate (Mortality):** The number of deaths per thousand people in a population in a given year.
*   **Growth Rate of Population:** The rate at which a population is increasing or decreasing in a given year due to natural increase and net migration.

## Problems Due to Population Explosion

*   **Unemployment:** A large population puts pressure on the job market, leading to high rates of unemployment.
*   **Over-exploitation of Natural Resources:** Increased demand for resources like water, food, and energy leads to their depletion and degradation.
*   **Low Per Capita Income:** A large population can lead to a lower per capita income, as the national income is divided among more people.
*   **Price Rise (Inflation):** High demand for goods and services can lead to an increase in their prices.
*   **Pollution:** A larger population generates more waste and pollution, leading to environmental degradation.
*   **Unequal Distribution of Wealth:** Population explosion can exacerbate existing inequalities in the distribution of wealth and resources.

## Population Control Measures

Population control is the practice of artificially altering the rate of growth of a human population. In India, the government has implemented various measures to control population growth.

### Surgical Methods

Surgical methods of contraception are permanent and highly effective.

*   **Vasectomy (Male Sterilization):**
    *   **Procedure:** A surgical procedure in which the vas deferens (the tubes that carry sperm from the testes) are cut or sealed.
    *   **Effect:** Prevents sperm from being released during ejaculation.
    *   **Reversibility:** Can sometimes be reversed, but the success rate is not guaranteed.

*   **Tubectomy (Female Sterilization):**
    *   **Procedure:** A surgical procedure in which the fallopian tubes (the tubes that carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus) are blocked or sealed.
    *   **Effect:** Prevents the egg from reaching the uterus and being fertilized.
    *   **Reversibility:** Difficult to reverse.
