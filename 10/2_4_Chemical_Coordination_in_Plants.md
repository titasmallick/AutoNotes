# Chemical Coordination in Plants

Plants do not have a nervous system, but they do have a system of chemical coordination that allows them to respond to their environment. This is achieved through the use of plant hormones or growth regulators.

## Growth Regulators

*   **Auxins:** Promote cell elongation, root formation, and fruit growth.
*   **Gibberellins:** Promote stem elongation, germination, and flowering.
*   **Cytokinins:** Promote cell division and delay senescence (aging).
*   **Abscisic Acid (ABA):** Inhibits growth, promotes dormancy, and helps the plant cope with stress.
*   **Ethylene:** Promotes fruit ripening and senescence.

## Tropisms

Tropisms are directional growth movements of a plant in response to a directional stimulus.

*   **Phototropism:** Growth in response to light.
*   **Geotropism:** Growth in response to gravity.
*   **Hydrotropism:** Growth in response to water.
*   **Thigmotropism:** Growth in response to touch.
*   **Chemotropism:** Growth in response to chemicals.
