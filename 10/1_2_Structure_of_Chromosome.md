# Structure of Chromosome

A chromosome is a thread-like structure of nucleic acids and protein found in the nucleus of most living cells, carrying genetic information in the form of genes.

*   **Chromatin:** The material of which the chromosomes of organisms other than bacteria (i.e., eukaryotes) are composed. It consists of protein, RNA, and DNA.
*   **Chromatid:** Each of the two thread-like strands into which a chromosome divides longitudinally during cell division. Each contains a double helix of DNA.
*   **Gene:** A unit of heredity which is transferred from a parent to offspring and is held to determine some characteristic of the offspring.
*   **DNA Structure:** DNA is a molecule composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix carrying genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses.
*   **Centromere:** The region of a chromosome to which the microtubules of the spindle attach, via the kinetochore, during cell division.
