# Human Evolution

Human evolution is the evolutionary process that led to the emergence of anatomically modern humans.

## Ancestors

*   **Australopithecus:** An early hominin that lived in Africa between 4 and 2 million years ago.
*   **Homo habilis:** An early species of Homo that lived in Africa between 2.4 and 1.6 million years ago.
*   **Homo erectus:** A species of Homo that lived in Africa, Asia, and Europe between 1.8 million and 117,000 years ago.
*   **Neanderthals:** A species of archaic humans that lived in Eurasia until about 40,000 years ago.
*   **Cro-Magnon:** The first early modern humans (early *Homo sapiens sapiens*) that lived in the European Upper Paleolithic.
*   **Homo sapiens sapiens:** The subspecies of *Homo sapiens* that consists of the only living humans.

## Features

*   **Bipedalism:** The ability to walk on two legs.
*   **Cranial Capacity:** The volume of the interior of the cranium.
*   **Chin:** A bony protuberance at the front of the lower jaw.
*   **Posture:** The way a person holds their body.
*   **Body Hair:** The hair that covers the body of a mammal.

## Theories

*   **Lamarckism:** The theory that acquired characteristics are inherited.
*   **Darwinism:** The theory of evolution by natural selection.
    *   **Example:** The peppered moth. In industrial areas, the darker form of the peppered moth became more common because it was better camouflaged against the soot-covered trees.
