# Cell Cycle and Cell Division

## Cell Cycle

The cell cycle is an ordered series of events that take place in a cell, leading to its division and the duplication of its DNA (DNA replication) to produce two daughter cells.

### Interphase

Interphase is the longest stage of the cell cycle, where the cell grows and prepares for division. It is divided into three phases:

*   **G1 (Gap 1) Phase:** The cell grows in size and synthesizes proteins and mRNA.
*   **S (Synthesis) Phase:** DNA replication occurs, resulting in the duplication of the cell's chromosomes.
*   **G2 (Gap 2) Phase:** The cell continues to grow and produce proteins needed for cell division.

## Mitosis

Mitosis is a type of cell division that results in two daughter cells each having the same number and kind of chromosomes as the parent nucleus, typical of ordinary tissue growth.

### Stages of Mitosis

1.  **Prophase:** Chromosomes condense and become visible. The nuclear envelope breaks down, and the spindle fibers begin to form.
2.  **Metaphase:** Chromosomes line up at the metaphase plate (the equator of the cell).
3.  **Anaphase:** Sister chromatids separate and are pulled to opposite poles of the cell.
4.  **Telophase:** Chromosomes arrive at the poles, and the nuclear envelope re-forms. The cytoplasm divides in a process called cytokinesis.

### Significance of Mitosis

*   Growth and development of multicellular organisms.
*   Asexual reproduction in some organisms.
*   Repair and replacement of old or damaged cells.

## Meiosis

Meiosis is a special type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, creating four haploid cells, each genetically distinct from the parent cell and from each other.

*   **Homologous Chromosomes:** Pairs of chromosomes with the same genes, one inherited from each parent.
*   **Crossing Over:** The exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes during prophase I of meiosis, resulting in genetic recombination.

## Differences between Mitosis and Meiosis

| Feature | Mitosis | Meiosis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Number of Divisions** | One | Two |
| **Daughter Cells** | Two diploid cells | Four haploid cells |
| **Genetic Variation** | No | Yes (due to crossing over) |
| **Chromosome Number**| Remains the same | Halved |
| **Role** | Growth, repair | Sexual reproduction |
