# Excretory System

The excretory system is responsible for removing waste products from the body.

## Excretory Organs

The main excretory organs are the kidneys, but the skin, lungs, and liver also play a role in excretion.

## Kidney

*   **Structure:** The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs that are located on either side of the spine. Each kidney is made up of millions of tiny filtering units called nephrons.
*   **Nephron:** The basic structural and functional unit of the kidney. It is responsible for filtering the blood and forming urine.

## Urinary System

The urinary system consists of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra.

*   **Ureters:** Tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder.
*   **Bladder:** A muscular sac that stores urine.
*   **Urethra:** A tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body.

## Blood Vessels

The renal artery supplies blood to the kidney, and the renal vein carries blood away from the kidney.

## Urine Formation

1.  **Ultrafiltration:** Blood is filtered in the glomerulus of the nephron, and small molecules like water, glucose, and urea pass into the Bowman's capsule.
2.  **Reabsorption:** As the filtrate passes through the renal tubule, essential substances like glucose, amino acids, and water are reabsorbed back into the blood.
3.  **Secretion:** Waste products like urea and creatinine are secreted from the blood into the renal tubule.
