# Nervous System

The nervous system is a complex network of nerves and cells that carry messages to and from the brain and spinal cord to various parts of the body.

## Neuron

A neuron is the basic working unit of the brain, a specialized cell designed to transmit information to other nerve cells, muscle, or gland cells.

## Divisions of the Nervous System

*   **Central Nervous System (CNS):** Consists of the brain and spinal cord.
*   **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS):** Consists of the nerves that branch out from the brain and spinal cord.
*   **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS):** Controls involuntary bodily functions like breathing, heart rate, and digestion.

## Brain

*   **Cerebrum:** The largest part of the brain, responsible for thought, language, and voluntary movement.
*   **Cerebellum:** Located at the back of the brain, responsible for balance and coordination.
*   **Medulla Oblongata:** Controls vital functions like breathing and heart rate.
*   **Thalamus:** Relays sensory information to the cerebral cortex.
*   **Hypothalamus:** Controls body temperature, hunger, and thirst.
*   **Pons:** Connects the cerebrum and cerebellum.

## Reflex Arc

A reflex arc is a neural pathway that controls a reflex. It consists of a sensory neuron, a motor neuron, and sometimes an interneuron.

*   **Voluntary Actions:** Actions that are under the control of the will.
*   **Involuntary Actions:** Actions that are not under the control of the will.

## Eye

*   **Structure:** The eye is a complex organ that allows us to see. It consists of the cornea, iris, pupil, lens, retina, and optic nerve.
*   **Function:** Light enters the eye and is focused on the retina, which contains photoreceptor cells that convert light into electrical signals. These signals are sent to the brain via the optic nerve.
*   **Defects:**
    *   **Myopia (Nearsightedness):** Difficulty seeing distant objects.
    *   **Hypermetropia (Farsightedness):** Difficulty seeing near objects.
    *   **Presbyopia:** Age-related farsightedness.
    *   **Astigmatism:** Blurred vision due to an irregularly shaped cornea.
    *   **Cataract:** Clouding of the lens.

## Ear

*   **Structure:** The ear is divided into three parts: the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear.
*   **Sound Perception:** Sound waves enter the ear and are converted into electrical signals, which are sent to the brain.
*   **Balance:** The inner ear also contains the vestibular system, which is responsible for balance.
