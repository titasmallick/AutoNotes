# Genetics

Genetics is the study of genes, genetic variation, and heredity in living organisms.

## Mendel's Laws

1.  **Law of Dominance:** In a cross of parents that are pure for contrasting traits, only one form of the trait will appear in the next generation. Offspring that are hybrid for a trait will have only the dominant trait in the phenotype.
2.  **Law of Segregation:** During the formation of gametes (eggs or sperm), the two alleles for a heritable character separate (segregate) from each other so that each gamete ends up with only one allele.
3.  **Law of Independent Assortment:** Genes for different traits are sorted separately from one another so that the inheritance of one trait is not dependent on the inheritance of another.

## Crosses

*   **Monohybrid Cross:** A cross between two organisms with different variations at one genetic locus of interest. The phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation is 3:1, and the genotypic ratio is 1:2:1.
*   **Dihybrid Cross:** A cross between two individuals who differ in two observed traits that are controlled by two distinct genes. The phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation is 9:3:3:1.

## Important Terms

*   **Gene:** A unit of heredity which is transferred from a parent to offspring.
*   **Allele:** One of two or more alternative forms of a gene that arise by mutation and are found at the same place on a chromosome.
*   **Homozygous:** Having two identical alleles for a particular gene.
*   **Heterozygous:** Having two different alleles for a particular gene.
*   **Dominant:** An allele that is expressed in an organism's phenotype, masking the effect of the recessive allele when present.
*   **Recessive:** An allele that is masked when a dominant allele is present.
*   **Mutation:** A permanent alteration in the DNA sequence that makes up a gene.
*   **Variation:** Any difference between cells, individual organisms, or groups of organisms of any species caused either by genetic differences or by the effect of environmental factors.
*   **Phenotype:** The set of observable characteristics of an individual resulting from the interaction of its genotype with the environment.
*   **Genotype:** The genetic constitution of an individual organism.

## Sex Determination in Humans

Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes. 22 pairs are autosomes, and one pair is the sex chromosomes (X and Y). Females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). The sex of the offspring is determined by the sperm from the father, which can carry either an X or a Y chromosome.

## X-linked Diseases

These are genetic conditions associated with mutations in genes on the X chromosome. Since males have only one X chromosome, they are more likely to be affected by these diseases.

*   **Haemophilia:** A medical condition in which the ability of the blood to clot is severely reduced, causing the sufferer to bleed severely from even a slight injury.
*   **Colour Blindness:** The inability or decreased ability to see color, or perceive color differences, under normal lighting conditions.
