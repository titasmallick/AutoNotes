# Transpiration

Transpiration is the process of water movement through a plant and its evaporation from aerial parts, such as leaves, stems and flowers.

## Process and Significance

Water is absorbed by the roots and then transported to the leaves. The evaporation of water from the leaf surface creates a tension or pull, which helps to draw more water up from the roots. This process is essential for:

*   **Cooling the plant:** Evaporation of water has a cooling effect.
*   **Transport of minerals:** The transpiration stream helps to transport minerals from the soil to the leaves.
*   **Maintaining turgor pressure:** Transpiration helps to maintain the turgidity of the plant cells.

## Ganong's Potometer

A Ganong's potometer is a device used for measuring the rate of water uptake by a leafy shoot. The rate of water uptake is nearly equal to the rate of transpiration.

## Experiments

Various experiments can be conducted to demonstrate transpiration, such as using a cobalt chloride paper to show that water vapor is released from the leaves.

## Factors Affecting Rate of Transpiration

*   **Light:** The rate of transpiration is higher in the light than in the dark.
*   **Temperature:** The rate of transpiration increases with an increase in temperature.
*   **Humidity:** The rate of transpiration is lower in high humidity.
*   **Wind:** The rate of transpiration increases with an increase in wind speed.

## Guttation and Bleeding

*   **Guttation:** The exudation of drops of xylem sap on the tips or edges of leaves of some vascular plants, such as grasses.
*   **Bleeding:** The loss of sap from the injured parts of a plant.
