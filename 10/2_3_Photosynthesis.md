# Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis is a process used by plants, algae, and certain bacteria to convert light energy into chemical energy, through a process that converts carbon dioxide and water into glucose (a sugar) and oxygen.

## Site and Process

Photosynthesis takes place in the chloroplasts, which are small organelles found in plant cells. The overall balanced equation for photosynthesis is:

**6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Light Energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂**

## Reactions

*   **Light-Dependent Reactions:** These reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts and require light energy. They involve:
    *   **Photolysis:** The splitting of water molecules into hydrogen ions, electrons, and oxygen.
    *   **Photophosphorylation:** The synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate using light energy.
    *   **NADPH Formation:** The reduction of NADP+ to NADPH.
*   **Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle):** These reactions occur in the stroma of the chloroplasts and do not require light. They use the ATP and NADPH from the light-dependent reactions to convert carbon dioxide into glucose.

## Adaptations

Plants have various adaptations to maximize photosynthesis, such as:

*   **Large surface area of leaves:** To absorb more sunlight.
*   **Thin leaves:** To allow for easy diffusion of gases.
*   **Stomata:** Pores on the leaf surface that allow for gas exchange.

## Carbon Cycle

The carbon cycle is the process by which carbon is exchanged between the atmosphere, oceans, land, and living organisms. Photosynthesis plays a crucial role in the carbon cycle by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

## Experiments

Several experiments can be performed to demonstrate the requirements for photosynthesis:

*   **Light is necessary:** A destarched plant with a part of a leaf covered with black paper will only show starch in the uncovered part.
*   **Carbon dioxide is necessary:** A destarched plant with a leaf enclosed in a flask containing potassium hydroxide (to absorb CO₂) will not show starch.
*   **Chlorophyll is necessary:** A variegated leaf (with green and non-green parts) will only show starch in the green parts.
*   **Starch is produced:** The iodine test is used to confirm the presence of starch.
*   **Oxygen is released:** An aquatic plant (like Elodea) placed in water under a funnel will release bubbles of oxygen in the presence of light.
