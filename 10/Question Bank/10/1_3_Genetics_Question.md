## Section C: Short Answer Questions (2 Marks)

1.  **Explain Mendel's Law of Dominance with an example.**
    The Law of Dominance states that in a cross between parents with contrasting traits, only the dominant trait will be expressed in the F1 generation. For example, when a purebred tall pea plant (TT) is crossed with a purebred short pea plant (tt), all F1 offspring will be tall (Tt) because the tall allele (T) is dominant over the short allele (t).

2.  **Describe the Law of Segregation with its significance.**
    The Law of Segregation states that during gamete formation, the two alleles for a trait separate, so each gamete receives only one allele. This is significant because it explains how genetic variation is maintained and passed on to offspring, allowing for different combinations of traits.

3.  **Explain how the Law of Independent Assortment works.**
    The Law of Independent Assortment states that genes for different traits are inherited independently of each other. This means that the allele a gamete receives for one gene does not influence the allele it receives for another gene. This occurs during meiosis when homologous chromosomes are randomly distributed into daughter cells.

4.  **Differentiate between genotype and phenotype with examples.**
    Genotype is the genetic makeup of an organism (e.g., TT, Tt, or tt for height). Phenotype is the observable physical characteristic (e.g., tall or short). An organism with the genotype TT or Tt will have the phenotype of being tall.

5.  **Explain why X-linked diseases are more common in males.**
    Males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY), while females have two X chromosomes (XX). Since males have only one X chromosome, a recessive allele on that chromosome will be expressed. Females, on the other hand, would need to inherit two recessive alleles to express the trait.

6.  **Describe the inheritance pattern of haemophilia.**
    Haemophilia is an X-linked recessive disorder. A male with the recessive allele on his X chromosome will have the disease. A female can be a carrier if she has one recessive allele. A female will only have the disease if she inherits the recessive allele from both parents.

7.  **Explain how sex is determined in humans.**
    Sex in humans is determined by the sex chromosomes. Females have two X chromosomes (XX) and males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). The egg cell always contains an X chromosome, while the sperm can contain either an X or a Y. If a sperm with an X chromosome fertilizes the egg, the offspring will be female (XX). If a sperm with a Y chromosome fertilizes the egg, the offspring will be male (XY).

8.  **Compare homozygous and heterozygous conditions.**
    An individual is homozygous for a gene if they have two identical alleles (e.g., TT or tt). An individual is heterozygous if they have two different alleles for a gene (e.g., Tt). Homozygous individuals will express the trait of their alleles, while heterozygous individuals will express the dominant trait.

9.  **Describe a monohybrid cross with expected ratios.**
    A monohybrid cross involves one trait. For example, crossing a homozygous tall pea plant (TT) with a homozygous short pea plant (tt). The F1 generation will all be heterozygous (Tt) and tall. The F2 generation, from crossing two F1 individuals, will have a phenotypic ratio of 3 tall to 1 short, and a genotypic ratio of 1 TT : 2 Tt : 1 tt.

10. **Explain a dihybrid cross and its outcome.**
    A dihybrid cross involves two traits. For example, crossing a plant with round, yellow seeds (RRYY) with a plant with wrinkled, green seeds (rryy). The F1 generation will all be RrYy. The F2 generation will have a phenotypic ratio of 9:3:3:1 (9 round yellow, 3 round green, 3 wrinkled yellow, 1 wrinkled green).

11. **What is the significance of test crosses in genetics?**
    A test cross is used to determine the genotype of an organism with a dominant phenotype. By crossing the unknown genotype with a homozygous recessive individual, the resulting offspring's phenotypes will reveal whether the unknown parent was homozygous dominant or heterozygous.

12. **Describe the difference between F1 and F2 generations.**
    The F1 (first filial) generation is the offspring resulting from a cross between two parental (P) generation individuals. The F2 (second filial) generation is the offspring resulting from a cross between two F1 generation individuals.

13. **Explain how mutations contribute to genetic variation.**
    Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence. They can create new alleles, which can lead to new traits. This is the ultimate source of all genetic variation, providing the raw material for evolution.

14. **Describe the relationship between genes and alleles.**
    A gene is a segment of DNA that codes for a specific trait. Alleles are different versions of the same gene. For example, the gene for eye color has alleles for blue, brown, green, etc.

15. **Explain the concept of dominance and recessiveness.**
    Dominance describes a relationship between alleles of one gene. If an allele is dominant, its phenotype will be expressed in a heterozygote. A recessive allele's phenotype is only expressed in a homozygote.

16. **Describe the structure and function of chromosomes.**
    Chromosomes are thread-like structures located inside the nucleus of animal and plant cells. Each chromosome is made of protein and a single molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). They carry the genetic information in the form of genes.

17. **Explain the difference between autosomes and sex chromosomes.**
    Autosomes are the chromosomes that are not sex chromosomes. Humans have 22 pairs of autosomes. Sex chromosomes determine the sex of an individual. Humans have one pair of sex chromosomes (XX for females, XY for males).

18. **Describe the process of gamete formation and segregation.**
    Gametes are formed through meiosis. During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes separate, and during meiosis II, sister chromatids separate. This process, known as segregation, ensures that each gamete receives only one allele for each gene.

19. **Explain how crossing over increases genetic variation.**
    Crossing over is the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes during meiosis I. This results in new combinations of alleles on the chromosomes, increasing genetic diversity in the offspring.

20. **Describe the significance of meiosis in inheritance.**
    Meiosis is significant because it reduces the number of chromosomes in gametes to half, ensuring that the diploid number is restored at fertilization. It also creates genetic variation through crossing over and independent assortment.

21. **Explain incomplete dominance with an example.**
    In incomplete dominance, the heterozygous phenotype is an intermediate between the two homozygous phenotypes. For example, in snapdragons, a cross between a red-flowered plant (RR) and a white-flowered plant (WW) results in pink-flowered offspring (RW).

22. **Describe codominance using ABO blood groups.**
    In codominance, both alleles are fully expressed in the heterozygote. In the ABO blood group system, the A and B alleles are codominant. An individual with both A and B alleles will have type AB blood, expressing both A and B antigens.

23. **Explain the concept of multiple alleles.**
    Multiple alleles exist when there are more than two possible alleles for a gene in a population. An individual can only have two of these alleles, but there are more than two options available in the gene pool. The ABO blood group system is an example.

24. **Describe epistasis and its types.**
    Epistasis is when the expression of one gene is affected by the expression of one or more other genes. There are several types, including recessive epistasis (where a recessive genotype at one locus masks the phenotype of another locus) and dominant epistasis (where a dominant allele at one locus masks the phenotype of another locus).

25. **Explain pleiotropy with examples.**
    Pleiotropy is when one gene influences multiple, seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits. For example, the gene that causes phenylketonuria (PKU) can also cause intellectual disability, seizures, and light skin and hair.

26. **Describe polygenic inheritance and its characteristics.**
    Polygenic inheritance is when a single trait is controlled by multiple genes. This results in a continuous range of phenotypes, rather than distinct categories. Human height, skin color, and weight are examples of polygenic traits.

27. **Explain the difference between penetrance and expressivity.**
    Penetrance is the proportion of individuals with a particular genotype that show the expected phenotype. Expressivity is the degree to which a genotype is expressed as a phenotype in an individual. For example, a gene may have 100% penetrance but variable expressivity.

28. **Describe genomic imprinting and its effects.**
    Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon where the expression of a gene depends on whether it was inherited from the mother or the father. This can lead to different phenotypes depending on the parent of origin of the allele.

29. **Explain maternal inheritance in organelles.**
    Maternal inheritance is the transmission of genes that are located in mitochondria or chloroplasts from the mother to all of her offspring. This is because the cytoplasm of the zygote comes primarily from the egg cell.

30. **Describe the Hardy-Weinberg principle.**
    The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that in a large, randomly mating population, allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation if other evolutionary influences are not operating. It provides a baseline for detecting evolutionary change.

31. **Explain genetic drift and its effects on populations.**
    Genetic drift is the random fluctuation of allele frequencies in a population, especially in small populations. It can lead to the loss of genetic variation and the fixation of alleles, which can have significant evolutionary consequences.

32. **Describe gene flow and its evolutionary significance.**
    Gene flow is the transfer of genetic material from one population to another. It can introduce new alleles into a population, increasing genetic variation. It can also make distant populations genetically similar to one another, reducing the chance of speciation.

33. **Explain the effects of inbreeding on populations.**
    Inbreeding is the mating of closely related individuals. It increases the frequency of homozygous genotypes and decreases the frequency of heterozygous genotypes. This can lead to an increased incidence of recessive genetic disorders.

34. **Describe how outbreeding affects genetic diversity.**
    Outbreeding is the mating of unrelated individuals. It increases genetic diversity by introducing new alleles into the gene pool. This can lead to hybrid vigor, where the offspring are healthier and more fertile than the parents.

35. **Explain the concept of linkage and recombination.**
    Linkage is the tendency of genes that are located close together on the same chromosome to be inherited together. Recombination is the process that separates linked genes, primarily through crossing over during meiosis.

36. **Describe the significance of genetic mapping.**
    Genetic mapping determines the relative positions of genes on a chromosome. It is useful for understanding the structure of genomes, identifying genes responsible for diseases, and in plant and animal breeding.

37. **Explain how pedigree analysis is used in genetics.**
    Pedigree analysis is the study of an inherited trait in a group of related individuals to determine the pattern and characteristics of the trait, including its mode of inheritance, age of onset, and expressivity.

38. **Describe the role of genetic counseling.**
    Genetic counseling provides information and support to individuals and families who have members with genetic disorders or who may be at risk for a variety of inherited conditions. It helps them understand and adapt to the medical, psychological, and familial implications of genetic contributions to disease.

39. **Explain the principles of genetic screening.**
    Genetic screening involves testing individuals in a population to identify those at risk of having or passing on a genetic disorder. It can be done at various stages, including newborn screening, carrier screening, and prenatal screening.

40. **Describe the applications of DNA fingerprinting.**
    DNA fingerprinting is used to identify individuals based on their unique DNA profiles. Its applications include forensic science (matching suspects to crime scenes), paternity testing, and identifying victims of disasters.

41. **Explain the concept of gene therapy.**
    Gene therapy is a technique that uses genes to treat or prevent disease. It may involve replacing a mutated gene with a healthy copy, inactivating a mutated gene, or introducing a new gene into the body to help fight a disease.

42. **Describe the process of genetic engineering.**
    Genetic engineering is the direct manipulation of an organism's genes using biotechnology. It involves isolating a gene, modifying it, and inserting it into an organism to produce a desired trait.

    The Human Genome Project was an international research effort to determine the sequence of the human genome and identify the genes that it contains. Its impact has been enormous, revolutionizing medicine, biotechnology, and life sciences.

45. **Explain the role of epigenetics in gene expression.**
    Epigenetics involves heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve changes to the underlying DNA sequence. These changes, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, can be influenced by the environment and play a crucial role in development and disease.

46. **Describe the mechanism of gene silencing.**
    Gene silencing is the interruption or suppression of the expression of a gene. It can occur at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. One mechanism is RNA interference (RNAi), where small RNA molecules inhibit gene expression.

47. **Explain the function of microRNAs in genetics.**
    MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that play a key role in regulating gene expression. They bind to messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules and either block their translation or cause them to be degraded, effectively silencing the gene.

48. **Describe pharmacogenetics and personalized medicine.**
    Pharmacogenetics is the study of how genetic variation affects an individual's response to drugs. This knowledge is used in personalized medicine to tailor drug treatments to an individual's genetic makeup, improving efficacy and reducing adverse effects.

49. **Explain the concept of genetic load in populations.**
    Genetic load is the presence of unfavorable genetic material in the genes of a population. It is the difference between the fitness of an optimal genotype and the average fitness of the population.

50. **Describe the role of natural selection in evolution.**
    Natural selection is a key mechanism of evolution. It is the process by which individuals with heritable traits that are better adapted to their environment tend to survive and reproduce more successfully than other individuals.

51. **Explain how environmental factors influence phenotype.**
    Environmental factors can have a significant impact on how a genotype is expressed as a phenotype. For example, nutrition can affect height, and sun exposure can affect skin color. This is known as phenotypic plasticity.

52. **Describe the difference between somatic and germ line mutations.**

## Section D: Long Answer Questions (3 Marks)

1.  **Explain Mendel's three laws of inheritance with suitable examples and their significance in modern genetics.**
    Mendel's three laws are the Law of Dominance, the Law of Segregation, and the Law of Independent Assortment.
    *   **Law of Dominance:** This law states that when two parents with different alleles for a trait are crossed, the offspring will express the dominant allele. For example, a tall pea plant (TT) crossed with a short pea plant (tt) will produce all tall offspring (Tt).
    *   **Law of Segregation:** This law states that the two alleles for each trait separate during meiosis, so that each gamete receives only one allele. This explains why offspring can have different traits from their parents.
    *   **Law of Independent Assortment:** This law states that alleles for different traits are inherited independently of one another. For example, the inheritance of seed color is independent of the inheritance of seed shape.
    These laws are significant because they form the basis of our understanding of heredity and are fundamental to modern genetics.

2.  **Describe the complete process of a monohybrid cross including P, F1, and F2 generations with Punnett squares and ratios.**
    A monohybrid cross involves one trait.
    *   **P generation:** A homozygous dominant parent (e.g., TT for tall) is crossed with a homozygous recessive parent (tt for short).
    *   **F1 generation:** All offspring are heterozygous (Tt) and express the dominant trait (tall).
    *   **F2 generation:** The F1 generation is self-crossed (Tt x Tt). A Punnett square shows the possible combinations of alleles in the offspring.
        | | T | t |
        |---|---|---|
        | **T** | TT | Tt |
        | **t** | Tt | tt |
    The genotypic ratio is 1 TT : 2 Tt : 1 tt. The phenotypic ratio is 3 tall : 1 short.

3.  **Explain dihybrid cross in detail with Punnett square, ratios, and significance of independent assortment.**
    A dihybrid cross involves two traits.
    *   **P generation:** A parent homozygous dominant for both traits (e.g., RRYY for round, yellow seeds) is crossed with a parent homozygous recessive for both traits (rryy for wrinkled, green seeds).
    *   **F1 generation:** All offspring are heterozygous for both traits (RrYy) and express both dominant traits (round, yellow seeds).
    *   **F2 generation:** The F1 generation is self-crossed (RrYy x RrYy). A 16-square Punnett square is used to show the possible combinations of alleles. The resulting phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1 (9 round yellow, 3 round green, 3 wrinkled yellow, 1 wrinkled green). This demonstrates the law of independent assortment, as the traits are inherited independently.

4.  **Describe the mechanism of sex determination in humans and explain why males are considered heterogametic sex.**
    In humans, sex is determined by the X and Y chromosomes. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), and males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). The egg always carries an X chromosome, while the sperm can carry either an X or a Y. If an X-carrying sperm fertilizes the egg, the offspring is female (XX). If a Y-carrying sperm fertilizes the egg, the offspring is male (XY). Males are considered the heterogametic sex because they produce two different types of gametes (X and Y), while females are the homogametic sex because they produce only one type of gamete (X).

5.  **Explain X-linked inheritance pattern with examples of haemophilia and color blindness, including carrier females.**
    X-linked inheritance refers to traits that are determined by genes on the X chromosome.
    *   **Haemophilia:** This is an X-linked recessive disorder that affects blood clotting. A male with the recessive allele on his X chromosome will have haemophilia. A female can be a carrier if she has one recessive allele.
    *   **Color blindness:** This is another X-linked recessive disorder. Similar to haemophilia, it is more common in males.
    A carrier female is heterozygous for the trait and does not express it, but she can pass the recessive allele to her offspring.

6.  **Describe the molecular basis of genetics including DNA structure, genes, alleles, and their relationship to inheritance.**
    The molecular basis of genetics is DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). DNA is a double helix molecule that contains the genetic instructions for the development and functioning of an organism. A gene is a segment of DNA that codes for a specific protein or functional RNA molecule. Alleles are different versions of a gene. The sequence of nucleotides in a gene determines the sequence of amino acids in a protein, which in turn determines the trait. Inheritance is the process by which genetic information is passed from parent to offspring.

7.  **Explain the process of meiosis and its significance in maintaining chromosome number and creating genetic variation.**
    Meiosis is a type of cell division that produces four daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. It consists of two rounds of division: Meiosis I and Meiosis II.
    *   **Meiosis I:** Homologous chromosomes separate.
    *   **Meiosis II:** Sister chromatids separate.
    Meiosis is significant because it ensures that the chromosome number is maintained from generation to generation. It also creates genetic variation through crossing over and independent assortment.

8.  **Describe incomplete dominance and codominance with suitable examples and explain how they differ from complete dominance.**
    *   **Incomplete dominance:** The heterozygous phenotype is an intermediate between the two homozygous phenotypes. For example, a red snapdragon (RR) crossed with a white snapdragon (WW) produces a pink snapdragon (RW).
    *   **Codominance:** Both alleles are fully expressed in the heterozygote. For example, in the ABO blood group system, a person with both A and B alleles has type AB blood.
    These differ from complete dominance, where the dominant allele completely masks the effect of the recessive allele in a heterozygote.

9.  **Explain the concept of multiple alleles using ABO blood group system as an example and describe its inheritance pattern.**
    Multiple alleles refer to a gene that has more than two alleles in a population. The ABO blood group system in humans is an example. There are three alleles: I^A, I^B, and i. I^A and I^B are codominant, and both are dominant to i. The possible genotypes and phenotypes are:
    *   **Type A:** I^A I^A or I^A i
    *   **Type B:** I^B I^B or I^B i
    *   **Type AB:** I^A I^B
    *   **Type O:** ii

10. **Describe epistasis in detail with different types and examples, explaining how gene interactions affect phenotype.**
    Epistasis is a form of gene interaction in which one gene masks the phenotypic expression of another gene. There are several types of epistasis, including:
    *   **Recessive epistasis:** The recessive genotype at one locus masks the expression of the alleles at another locus. For example, in Labrador retrievers, the gene for coat color is epistatic to the gene for pigment deposition.
    *   **Dominant epistasis:** The dominant allele at one locus masks the expression of the alleles at another locus.
    Epistasis demonstrates that genes do not always act independently and that the phenotype is often the result of complex interactions between multiple genes.

11. **Explain pleiotropy with examples and describe how single genes can affect multiple characteristics.**
    Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple, seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits. For example, the gene that causes sickle cell anemia also provides resistance to malaria. This is because the gene product is involved in multiple cellular processes. Another example is phenylketonuria (PKU), which can cause intellectual disability, seizures, and light skin and hair.

12. **Describe polygenic inheritance and explain how multiple genes contribute to quantitative traits like height and skin color.**
    Polygenic inheritance is when a single trait is controlled by multiple genes. Each gene has a small, additive effect on the phenotype. This results in a continuous range of phenotypes, rather than distinct categories. For example, human height is influenced by hundreds of genes, as well as environmental factors. The more "tall" alleles a person has, the taller they are likely to be.

13. **Explain the Hardy-Weinberg principle, its assumptions, and significance in population genetics.**
    The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that in a large, randomly mating population, allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation if other evolutionary influences are not operating. The assumptions are: no mutation, no gene flow, random mating, no genetic drift, and no natural selection. The principle is significant because it provides a baseline against which to measure evolutionary change.

14. **Describe genetic drift, its types, and effects on allele frequencies in small and large populations.**
    Genetic drift is the random fluctuation of allele frequencies in a population. It is more pronounced in small populations. There are two main types:
    *   **Bottleneck effect:** A sharp reduction in the size of a population due to environmental events or human activities.
    *   **Founder effect:** The loss of genetic variation that occurs when a new population is established by a small number of individuals from a larger population.
    Genetic drift can lead to the loss of genetic variation and the fixation of alleles.

15. **Explain gene flow and its role in maintaining genetic diversity and evolutionary processes.**
    Gene flow is the transfer of genetic material from one population to another. It can introduce new alleles into a population, increasing genetic variation. It can also make distant populations genetically similar to one another, reducing the chance of speciation. Gene flow is an important mechanism of evolution.

16. **Describe inbreeding and outbreeding, their effects on populations, and significance in breeding programs.**
    *   **Inbreeding:** The mating of closely related individuals. It increases homozygosity and can lead to inbreeding depression, where the fitness of the population is reduced.
    *   **Outbreeding:** The mating of unrelated individuals. It increases heterozygosity and can lead to hybrid vigor, where the offspring are more fit than their parents.
    In breeding programs, inbreeding is used to fix desirable traits, while outbreeding is used to introduce new traits and increase genetic diversity.

17. **Explain linkage and crossing over, describing how they affect inheritance patterns and genetic mapping.**
    *   **Linkage:** The tendency of genes that are located close together on the same chromosome to be inherited together.
    *   **Crossing over:** The exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes during meiosis.
    Linkage reduces the amount of recombination between genes, while crossing over increases it. The frequency of recombination between two genes is proportional to the distance between them on the chromosome. This relationship is used to create genetic maps.
	
18. **Describe the construction and interpretation of genetic maps using recombination frequencies.**
    Genetic maps show the relative locations of genes on a chromosome. They are constructed by measuring the frequency of recombination between genes. The unit of distance on a genetic map is the map unit (or centimorgan), which is equal to a 1% recombination frequency. By measuring the recombination frequencies between multiple genes, a genetic map can be constructed.

19. **Explain pedigree analysis and its applications in human genetics for tracking inherited disorders.**
    Pedigree analysis is the study of an inherited trait in a group of related individuals to determine the pattern and characteristics of the trait. It is used to determine the mode of inheritance of a trait (e.g., dominant, recessive, X-linked), to calculate the probability of an individual inheriting a trait, and to identify carriers of a trait.

20. **Describe genetic counseling, its importance, and role in family planning for genetic disorders.**
    Genetic counseling is a process that helps people understand and adapt to the medical, psychological, and familial implications of genetic contributions to disease. It is important for individuals and families who are affected by or at risk of genetic disorders. Genetic counselors can help people make informed decisions about their health and family planning.

21. **Explain genetic screening methods and their applications in detecting inherited diseases.**
    Genetic screening is the process of testing a population for a genetic disease. There are several methods, including:
    *   **Newborn screening:** Testing newborns for a variety of genetic disorders.
    *   **Carrier screening:** Testing individuals to see if they are carriers of a recessive genetic disorder.
    *   **Prenatal screening:** Testing a fetus for genetic disorders before birth.
    Genetic screening can help to identify individuals who are at risk of developing a genetic disease, so that they can receive early treatment.

22. **Describe DNA fingerprinting technique, its principles, and applications in forensics and paternity testing.**
    DNA fingerprinting is a technique that is used to identify individuals by their DNA. It is based on the fact that every individual has a unique DNA sequence. The technique involves extracting DNA from a sample, cutting it into fragments, and then separating the fragments by size. The resulting pattern of fragments is the DNA fingerprint. DNA fingerprinting is used in forensics to identify criminals and in paternity testing to determine the father of a child.

23. **Explain gene therapy approaches, their potential benefits, and current limitations in treating genetic disorders.**
    Gene therapy is a technique that uses genes to treat or prevent disease. There are two main approaches:
    *   **Somatic gene therapy:** The transfer of a section of DNA to any cell of the body that doesn’t produce sperm or eggs.
    *   **Germline gene therapy:** The transfer of a section of DNA to cells that produce eggs or sperm.
    Gene therapy has the potential to cure a wide range of genetic disorders, but it is still in the early stages of development and there are a number of challenges that need to be overcome.

24. **Describe genetic engineering techniques and their applications in producing transgenic organisms.**

30. **Describe the role of natural selection in shaping allele frequencies and evolutionary processes.**
    Natural selection is the process by which individuals with heritable traits that are better adapted to their environment tend to survive and reproduce more successfully than other individuals. This leads to an increase in the frequency of the advantageous alleles in the population over time. Natural selection is a major driving force of evolution.

31. **Explain how environmental factors interact with genetic factors to influence phenotypic expression.**
