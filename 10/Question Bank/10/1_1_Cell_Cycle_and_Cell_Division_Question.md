## Section D: Three Marks Questions

1.  The cell cycle consists of Interphase (G1, S, G2) and the M phase (Mitosis/Meiosis and Cytokinesis). G1 is for growth and protein synthesis. S phase is for DNA replication. G2 is for further growth and preparation for division. The M phase is where the cell divides. Each phase is crucial for ensuring that the cell is ready for division and that the daughter cells are viable.
2.  Mitosis is a process of cell division that results in two genetically identical daughter cells. It has four stages: Prophase (chromosomes condense), Metaphase (chromosomes align at the center), Anaphase (sister chromatids separate), and Telophase (new nuclei form). It is essential for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction.
3.  Mitosis and meiosis are both forms of cell division. Mitosis produces two identical diploid cells and is involved in growth and repair. Meiosis produces four unique haploid cells and is involved in sexual reproduction. Meiosis has two rounds of division and involves crossing over, which creates genetic variation.
4.  Meiosis is a two-stage process of cell division. Meiosis I separates homologous chromosomes, and Meiosis II separates sister chromatids. It leads to the formation of four haploid cells, each with a unique combination of genes due to crossing over and independent assortment.
5.  Crossing over occurs during Prophase I of meiosis, where homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material. This creates new combinations of alleles on the chromosomes, which is a major source of genetic diversity and provides the raw material for evolution by natural selection.
6.  Cell cycle checkpoints are control points that monitor the progression of the cell cycle. The main checkpoints are the G1/S checkpoint, the G2/M checkpoint, and the spindle checkpoint. They prevent errors in DNA replication and chromosome segregation, and their failure can lead to mutations and cancer.
7.  Gametogenesis is the process of forming gametes. In males, spermatogenesis produces four sperm cells from a primary spermatocyte. In females, oogenesis produces one large egg cell and polar bodies from a primary oocyte. Spermatogenesis is a continuous process, while oogenesis is arrested at certain stages.
8.  Chromosomal disorders can result from errors in meiosis, such as nondisjunction. This can lead to conditions like Down syndrome (Trisomy 21), Turner syndrome (XO), and Klinefelter syndrome (XXY). These conditions are caused by an abnormal number of chromosomes and have various physical and developmental consequences.
9.  Alternation of generations is a life cycle found in plants and some algae, where there is an alternation between a multicellular diploid sporophyte and a multicellular haploid gametophyte. The sporophyte produces spores by meiosis, and the gametophyte produces gametes by mitosis.
10. Cell division is fundamental to life. It allows for the growth of multicellular organisms from a single cell. It is also essential for repairing damaged tissues and replacing old cells. In many organisms, it is the basis of reproduction, both asexual and sexual.
11. Cancer develops when cells lose control over their division and proliferate uncontrollably. This is often due to mutations in genes that regulate the cell cycle, such as oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. These mutations can lead to the formation of tumors and the spread of cancer to other parts of the body.
12. The regulation of the cell cycle is crucial for normal growth and development. When this regulation breaks down, it can lead to uncontrolled cell division and the development of diseases like cancer.
13. Fertilization is the fusion of a male and a female gamete to form a zygote. This process restores the diploid chromosome number and triggers the development of a new individual.
14. Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that can differentiate into specialized cells and can divide to produce more stem cells. There are different types of stem cells, such as totipotent, pluripotent, and multipotent stem cells. They have great potential in medicine for repairing damaged tissues and treating diseases.
15. The process of aging is linked to cell division. Most cells have a limited number of times they can divide, known as the Hayflick limit. This is related to the shortening of telomeres, which are protective caps on the ends of chromosomes.
16. Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of gametes from two parents, leading to genetic variation in the offspring. Asexual reproduction involves a single parent and produces genetically identical offspring. Sexual reproduction is advantageous in changing environments, while asexual reproduction is advantageous in stable environments.
17. Cell division is controlled by a complex network of proteins, including cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). These proteins regulate the progression through the different phases of the cell cycle and are controlled by various checkpoints.
18. Environmental factors such as radiation and certain chemicals can damage DNA and interfere with cell division. This can lead to mutations and increase the risk of cancer.
19. DNA repair mechanisms are essential for maintaining the integrity of the genome. They correct errors that occur during DNA replication and damage caused by environmental factors. These mechanisms are closely linked to cell cycle checkpoints and are crucial for preventing cancer.
20. Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death that is essential for normal development and for removing damaged or infected cells. It is a highly regulated process that plays a key role in preventing cancer.
21. During cell division, chromosomes are condensed and organized by the spindle apparatus, which is made of microtubules. The spindle ensures that the chromosomes are accurately segregated to the daughter cells.
22. Prokaryotic cells divide by a simple process called binary fission, while eukaryotic cells have a more complex process of cell division involving mitosis or meiosis.
23. Ploidy refers to the number of sets of chromosomes in a cell. Changes in chromosome number, such as aneuploidy and polyploidy, can have significant effects on an organism's development and health.
24. Cell division is essential for the function of the immune system. Immune cells, such as lymphocytes, divide rapidly to mount a response against pathogens.
25. Plant cell division differs from animal cell division in that plant cells form a cell plate during cytokinesis, while animal cells form a cleavage furrow. Plant cells also have a rigid cell wall that must be taken into account during division.
26. The size of a cell is a key factor that triggers cell division. As a cell grows, its surface area-to-volume ratio decreases, which can make it difficult for the cell to transport nutrients and waste products. This can trigger the cell to divide.
27. Regeneration is the process by which some organisms can regrow lost or damaged body parts. This process relies on cell division to produce new cells to replace the lost tissue.
28. Hormones can regulate cell division in both plants and animals. For example, growth hormones can stimulate cell division, while other hormones can inhibit it.
29. Cell senescence is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest that can be triggered by various factors, such as telomere shortening and DNA damage. It is thought to play a role in aging and cancer prevention.
30. Sexual reproduction is evolutionarily significant because it creates genetic variation in a population, which is the raw material for natural selection. Meiosis, with its processes of crossing over and independent assortment, is the key to this variation.
31. Errors in cell division can lead to genetic disorders such as Down syndrome and Turner syndrome. These disorders can be detected using methods such as karyotyping and genetic testing.
32. Cell division is essential for wound healing and tissue repair. When a tissue is damaged, cells in the surrounding area divide to produce new cells to replace the damaged ones.
33. Totipotency and pluripotency are properties of stem cells that describe their ability to differentiate into other cell types. Totipotent cells can differentiate into any cell type, while pluripotent cells can differentiate into most, but not all, cell types. These properties are important for development and regenerative medicine.
34. Cell division is tightly regulated during development to ensure that tissues and organs are formed correctly. This regulation is controlled by a complex network of genes and signaling pathways.
35. Nutrition can affect cell division by providing the necessary building blocks and energy for cell growth and replication. A lack of nutrients can cause cells to stop dividing.
36. Oxygen is essential for aerobic respiration, which provides the energy for cell division. Hypoxia, or a lack of oxygen, can inhibit cell division.
37. Radiation and chemicals can damage DNA and interfere with cell division. This can lead to mutations and increase the risk of cancer.
38. During embryonic development, cells divide and differentiate to form the various tissues and organs of the body. This process is controlled by a complex network of genes and signaling pathways.
39. Contact inhibition is a process that stops cells from dividing when they come into contact with each other. This is an important mechanism for controlling cell growth in tissues.
40. Some viruses can interfere with cell division and cause cancer. They do this by inserting their own genes into the host cell's DNA, which can disrupt the normal regulation of the cell cycle.
41. Telomeres are protective caps on the ends of chromosomes that shorten with each cell division. Telomerase is an enzyme that can lengthen telomeres, and its activity is important for cellular lifespan.
42. Meiotic drive is a process that can cause some alleles to be passed on to the next generation more often than others. This can affect inheritance patterns and have evolutionary consequences.
43. Hybrid vigor, or heterosis, is the tendency of a crossbred individual to show qualities superior to those of both parents. This is thought to be due to the increased genetic variation that results from sexual reproduction.
44. Cell division is essential for plant growth and development. Meristematic tissues are regions of actively dividing cells that are responsible for the growth of the plant.
45. Cell division contributes to homeostasis by replacing old or damaged cells and by allowing for growth and repair.
46. Normal cell division is a tightly regulated process, while cancer cell division is uncontrolled. Cancer cells have lost the ability to respond to the signals that normally control cell growth.
47. Cell division plays a key role in the life cycles of all organisms. In some organisms, it is the basis of reproduction, while in others, it is essential for growth and development.
48. The patterns of cell division during development determine the formation of different tissue types and organ systems.
49. Cell division is an energy-intensive process that requires a lot of ATP. The metabolism of the cell changes during the cell cycle to meet these energy demands.
50. Research on cell division has the potential to lead to new treatments for diseases such as cancer and to new applications in biotechnology, such as regenerative medicine.
