## SECTION D: LONG ANSWER QUESTIONS

1.  The hierarchical organization of DNA begins with the double helix, which is then wrapped around histone proteins to form nucleosomes. These nucleosomes are coiled into a 30-nm fiber, which is further looped and compacted to form the final chromosome structure. This organization allows for the efficient packaging of the large amount of DNA in a eukaryotic cell, while also allowing for the regulation of gene expression by controlling the accessibility of the DNA to transcription factors.
2.  Prokaryotic chromosomes are typically circular, located in the cytoplasm, and are not associated with histones. Eukaryotic chromosomes are linear, located in the nucleus, and are composed of chromatin (DNA and histone proteins). The evolutionary significance of these differences is that the more complex organization of eukaryotic chromosomes allows for a greater degree of gene regulation and the evolution of more complex organisms.
3.  Chromosome condensation is driven by the condensin complex, which uses ATP to introduce positive supercoils into the DNA, leading to its compaction. Histone modifications, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, also play a role in regulating the condensation process.
4.  The centromere is a constricted region of a chromosome that holds the two sister chromatids together. It is the site of kinetochore formation, which is essential for the attachment of spindle fibers during cell division. Defects in centromere function can lead to chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy, which can cause genetic disorders and cancer.
5.  The structure of chromatin can affect gene expression. Loosely packed euchromatin allows for transcription factors to access the DNA and activate genes, while tightly packed heterochromatin prevents gene expression. For example, the globin genes are located in an open chromatin domain in red blood cells, where they are actively transcribed, but are in a condensed chromatin state in other cell types, where they are silenced.
6.  During meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair up, exchange genetic material (crossing over), and then segregate into different daughter cells. This is followed by a second division that separates the sister chromatids. Crossing over creates new combinations of alleles, and the independent assortment of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I further increases genetic diversity.
7.  Chromosome abnormalities include numerical abnormalities (aneuploidy, polyploidy) and structural abnormalities (deletions, duplications, inversions, translocations). For example, Down syndrome is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21), and is associated with intellectual disability and characteristic physical features.
8.  Epigenetic inheritance is the inheritance of traits that are not due to changes in the DNA sequence itself, but rather to modifications of the chromatin, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications. These modifications can be influenced by environmental factors, such as diet and stress, and can affect gene expression and disease risk.
9.  Techniques for chromosome analysis include karyotyping, which is a low-resolution method that can detect large-scale abnormalities; FISH, which is a higher-resolution method that can detect specific DNA sequences; and chromosomal microarray analysis, which is a high-resolution method that can detect small deletions and duplications.
10. Chromosome instability is a hallmark of cancer. It can lead to the loss of tumor suppressor genes and the activation of oncogenes, which can drive the development and progression of the disease. Therapeutic approaches that target chromosome instability are currently being developed.
11. Chromosome movement during mitosis is driven by the spindle apparatus, which is a complex machine made of microtubules and motor proteins. The motor proteins use ATP to move the chromosomes along the microtubules, and regulatory mechanisms ensure that the chromosomes are properly attached to the spindle before they are segregated.
12. The evolution of chromosome structure involves changes in chromosome number and organization over time. These changes can be driven by chromosome rearrangements, such as inversions and translocations, which can create new combinations of genes and contribute to the evolution of new species.
13. The three-dimensional organization of chromosomes within the nucleus is non-random. Each chromosome occupies a distinct territory, and the positioning of these territories can influence gene expression.
14. The structure of chromatin affects DNA replication by regulating the accessibility of the DNA to the replication machinery. Euchromatin is replicated early in S phase, while heterochromatin is replicated late in S phase.
15. Cells have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to repair chromosome damage and maintain genomic stability. These mechanisms include DNA repair pathways, cell cycle checkpoints, and apoptosis.
16. Cellular differentiation involves changes in chromosome structure and gene expression that lead to the development of specialized cell types. These changes are often mediated by epigenetic modifications that establish and maintain cell-type-specific gene expression patterns.
17. Chromosome instability is a condition in which chromosomes are prone to breakage and rearrangement. It can be caused by defects in DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoints, or chromatin remodeling. It can lead to genetic disorders and cancer.
18. Environmental factors, such as radiation and chemicals, can damage chromosomes and lead to mutations and disease. Cells can adapt to environmental stress by altering their chromosome structure and gene expression patterns.
19. Artificial chromosomes are engineered DNA molecules that can be used to carry large fragments of DNA into cells. They have potential applications in gene therapy, biotechnology, and basic research.
20. The ethical and social implications of chromosome research include the potential for genetic discrimination, the use of genetic information for non-medical purposes, and the safety of genetic engineering technologies.
21. Chromosome structure changes with age, including telomere shortening and the accumulation of epigenetic modifications. These changes can contribute to the decline in cellular function and the development of age-related diseases.
22. The nucleus is a highly organized organelle, and the positioning of chromosomes within the nucleus can influence their function. For example, genes that are located near the nuclear lamina are often silenced.
23. Chromosome cohesion is the process by which sister chromatids are held together by the cohesin complex. The separation of sister chromatids is triggered by the cleavage of cohesin by the enzyme separase.
24. Stem cells have a unique chromatin structure that is characterized by a high degree of plasticity and the potential to differentiate into any cell type. This plasticity is lost as cells differentiate.
25. The faithful inheritance of chromosomes is essential for genetic continuity. Errors in chromosome inheritance can lead to aneuploidy and genetic disease.
