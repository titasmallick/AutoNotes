# Unit 5: Ecology and Environment - Chapter 2: Ecosystem

## 5.2 Ecosystem

### Types and Components: Biotic, Abiotic

An **ecosystem** is a functional unit of nature, where living organisms (biotic components) interact among themselves and also with the surrounding physical environment (abiotic components).

**Types of Ecosystems:**

1.  **Natural Ecosystems:** Exist without significant human intervention.
    *   **Terrestrial:** Forests, grasslands, deserts, tundra.
    *   **Aquatic:** Ponds, lakes, rivers, oceans, estuaries.
2.  **Artificial (Man-made) Ecosystems:** Created and maintained by humans.
    *   Crop fields, aquariums, gardens, dams.

**Components of an Ecosystem:**

1.  **Abiotic Components (Non-living):**
    *   **Climatic Factors:** Temperature, light, water, wind, humidity, rainfall.
    *   **Edaphic Factors:** Soil (pH, mineral composition, topography).
    *   **Inorganic Substances:** Carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen, water, phosphorus, calcium.
    *   **Organic Substances:** Proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, humic substances (link biotic and abiotic components).

2.  **Biotic Components (Living):**
    *   **Producers (Autotrophs):** Organisms that produce their own food, primarily through photosynthesis (e.g., green plants, algae, cyanobacteria). In deep-sea hydrothermal vents, chemosynthetic bacteria are producers.
    *   **Consumers (Heterotrophs):** Organisms that depend on producers or other consumers for food.
        *   **Primary Consumers (Herbivores):** Feed directly on producers (e.g., deer, rabbit, insects).
        *   **Secondary Consumers (Primary Carnivores):** Feed on primary consumers (e.g., frog, small birds).
        *   **Tertiary Consumers (Secondary Carnivores):** Feed on secondary consumers (e.g., snake, large fish).
        *   **Quaternary Consumers (Tertiary Carnivores):** Feed on tertiary consumers (e.g., eagle, lion).
    *   **Decomposers (Saprotrophs):** Organisms that break down dead organic matter (detritus) of producers and consumers into simpler inorganic substances (e.g., bacteria, fungi). They play a crucial role in nutrient cycling.

### Pond Ecosystem

A pond is a shallow, freshwater aquatic ecosystem. It serves as a good example to understand the basic structure and function of an ecosystem.

**Abiotic Components:**
*   **Water:** The medium for all life processes.
*   **Sunlight:** Penetrates to varying depths, supporting photosynthesis.
*   **Dissolved Oxygen:** Essential for aquatic respiration.
*   **Inorganic Salts:** Nutrients like nitrates, phosphates, carbonates, sulfates.
*   **Organic Substances:** Humus, amino acids, fatty acids from decaying matter.
*   **Temperature:** Varies with depth and season.

**Biotic Components:**
*   **Producers:**
    *   **Phytoplankton:** Microscopic, free-floating algae (e.g., *Spirogyra*, *Volvox*, diatoms).
    *   **Floating Plants:** (e.g., *Lemna*, *Azolla*, *Pistia*).
    *   **Submerged Plants:** (e.g., *Hydrilla*, *Vallisneria*).
    *   **Marginal Plants:** (e.g., *Typha*, *Sagittaria*).
*   **Consumers:**
    *   **Primary Consumers (Zooplankton):** Microscopic animals that feed on phytoplankton (e.g., *Daphnia*, *Cyclops*).
    *   **Secondary Consumers:** Small fish, insects, frogs that feed on zooplankton and small aquatic animals.
    *   **Tertiary Consumers:** Large fish, birds (e.g., kingfisher) that feed on smaller fish and frogs.
*   **Decomposers:** Bacteria and fungi (e.g., *Aspergillus*, *Penicillium*) that break down dead organic matter at the bottom of the pond.

### Productivity: GPP, NPP, Secondary Productivity

**Productivity** refers to the rate of biomass production or the rate at which energy is accumulated in an ecosystem.

1.  **Primary Productivity:** The rate at which producers (plants) synthesize organic matter from inorganic substances, primarily through photosynthesis.
    *   **Gross Primary Productivity (GPP):** The total rate of organic matter production during photosynthesis. It includes the organic matter used by producers for their own respiration.
    *   **Net Primary Productivity (NPP):** The amount of organic matter remaining after producers have utilized some for their own respiration (R). It is the available biomass for heterotrophs.
        `NPP = GPP - R`
    *   Units: g/m²/year (for biomass) or kcal/m²/year (for energy).

2.  **Secondary Productivity:** The rate of formation of new organic matter by consumers (heterotrophs). It is the rate of assimilation of food by consumers.

### Decomposition: Steps, Factors

**Decomposition** is the process by which decomposers (bacteria and fungi) break down complex organic matter (detritus) into simpler inorganic substances like CO2, water, and nutrients. It is a vital process for nutrient cycling.

**Steps of Decomposition:**

1.  **Fragmentation:** Detritivores (e.g., earthworms) break down detritus into smaller particles, increasing the surface area for microbial action.
2.  **Leaching:** Water-soluble inorganic nutrients seep down into the soil horizon and get precipitated as unavailable salts.
3.  **Catabolism:** Bacterial and fungal enzymes degrade detritus into simpler inorganic substances.
4.  **Humification:** Accumulation of a dark-colored, amorphous substance called humus. Humus is highly resistant to microbial action and undergoes decomposition at an extremely slow rate. It is a reservoir of nutrients.
5.  **Mineralization:** Humus is further degraded by some microbes, releasing inorganic nutrients (e.g., CO2, H2O, mineral ions) into the soil.

**Factors Affecting Decomposition:**

*   **Chemical Composition of Detritus:** Decomposition rate is slower if detritus is rich in lignin and chitin, and quicker if rich in nitrogen and water-soluble sugars.
*   **Temperature:** Optimal temperature (warm) favors decomposition. Low temperatures inhibit it.
*   **Moisture:** Adequate moisture is essential. Too dry or too wet conditions inhibit decomposition.
*   **Aeration:** Oxygen is required for aerobic decomposition. Anaerobic conditions slow down the process.
*   **pH:** Neutral to slightly alkaline pH is generally favorable.

### Energy Flow: Food Chains (Grazing, Detritus), Food Webs, Trophic Levels

**Energy Flow** in an ecosystem is unidirectional and follows the laws of thermodynamics. Energy enters the ecosystem from the sun, is captured by producers, and then flows through various trophic levels.

1.  **Food Chain:** A sequence of organisms through which energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next by feeding.
    *   **Grazing Food Chain (GFC):** Starts with producers (plants) and moves to herbivores and then to carnivores.
        *   Example: Grass → Deer → Tiger
    *   **Detritus Food Chain (DFC):** Starts with dead organic matter (detritus) and moves to decomposers (bacteria, fungi) and then to detritivores.
        *   Example: Dead leaves → Fungi → Earthworm → Bird
        *   In aquatic ecosystems, GFC is the major conduit for energy flow. In terrestrial ecosystems, a large fraction of energy flows through the DFC.

2.  **Food Web:** A network of interconnected food chains, showing the complex feeding relationships within an ecosystem. It is more realistic than a simple food chain as organisms often feed on multiple types of prey and are themselves preyed upon by multiple predators.

3.  **Trophic Levels:** The position an organism occupies in a food chain, based on its feeding habits.
    *   **Trophic Level 1:** Producers (Autotrophs) - e.g., Plants
    *   **Trophic Level 2:** Primary Consumers (Herbivores) - e.g., Deer, Rabbit
    *   **Trophic Level 3:** Secondary Consumers (Primary Carnivores) - e.g., Fox, Snake
    *   **Trophic Level 4:** Tertiary Consumers (Secondary Carnivores) - e.g., Lion, Eagle
    *   Decomposers occupy all trophic levels as they break down dead organic matter from all levels.

### Ecological Pyramids: Energy, Number, Biomass

**Ecological Pyramids** are graphical representations of the relationship between different trophic levels in an ecosystem. The base of the pyramid represents the producers, and successive levels represent consumers.

1.  **Pyramid of Energy:**
    *   Always upright.
    *   Represents the total amount of energy at each trophic level.
    *   Energy decreases progressively at successive trophic levels because a large portion of energy is lost as heat during metabolic activities (10% Law).
    *   Units: kcal/m²/year or J/m²/year.

2.  **Pyramid of Number:**
    *   Represents the number of individual organisms at each trophic level.
    *   Can be upright, inverted, or spindle-shaped.
        *   **Upright:** In grassland ecosystem (e.g., Grass > Grasshopper > Frog > Snake > Eagle).
        *   **Inverted:** In a parasitic food chain (e.g., Single tree > Birds > Lice).
        *   **Spindle-shaped:** In a forest ecosystem (e.g., Large trees < Deer > Fox).

3.  **Pyramid of Biomass:**
    *   Represents the total dry weight (biomass) of organisms at each trophic level.
    *   Can be upright or inverted.
        *   **Upright:** In most terrestrial ecosystems (e.g., Grassland: Producers > Herbivores > Carnivores).
        *   **Inverted:** In aquatic ecosystems (e.g., Pond: Phytoplankton < Zooplankton < Small fish < Large fish). This is because phytoplankton have a very short lifespan and reproduce rapidly, so at any given time, their biomass is less than that of the zooplankton they support.

### PAR, 10% Law, Standing Crop/State

1.  **Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR):**
    *   The portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (wavelengths 400-700 nm) that photosynthetic organisms are able to use in the process of photosynthesis.
    *   Of the total incident solar radiation, less than 50% is PAR.
    *   Plants capture only 2-10% of the PAR.

2.  **10% Law (Lindeman's Law):**
    *   Proposed by Raymond Lindeman in 1942.
    *   States that only about 10% of the energy from one trophic level is transferred to the next trophic level.
    *   The remaining 90% is lost as heat during metabolic processes or remains unconsumed/undigested.
    *   This explains why food chains rarely consist of more than 4-5 trophic levels.

3.  **Standing Crop/State:**
    *   **Standing Crop:** The amount of living biomass (or the number of organisms) present at a particular trophic level at a given time.
    *   **Standing State:** The amount of inorganic nutrients (e.g., carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium) present in the soil or water at a given time. It is also known as the nutrient pool.
