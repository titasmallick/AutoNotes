## SECTION C: SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS - Answers

1.  **Three types of biodiversity:**
    *   **Genetic Diversity:** Variation in genes within a species. Example: Different strains of rice in India.
    *   **Species Diversity:** Variety of species in a region. Example: The Western Ghats have more amphibian species than the Eastern Ghats.
    *   **Ecosystem Diversity:** Variety of ecosystems in a geographical area. Example: India has deserts, rainforests, and wetlands, unlike Norway.

2.  **Species Richness vs. Species Evenness:** Species richness is the total number of different species in an area. Species evenness is the relative abundance of individuals of each of those species. A community can be rich in species but have low evenness if one species dominates.

3.  **Latitudinal Gradient:** Species diversity generally decreases as one moves from the equator towards the poles. Tropical regions, with their stable climate and high productivity, support a greater variety of species than temperate or polar regions.

4.  **Species-Area Relationship:** Proposed by Alexander von Humboldt, it states that species richness increases with increasing explored area, up to a limit. The relationship is described by the equation `S = CA^Z`, where S is species richness, A is area, C is the Y-intercept, and Z is the slope of the line.

5.  **Why Tropics Have Higher Biodiversity:**
    *   **Stable Climate:** Tropical regions have remained relatively undisturbed for millions of years, allowing for long evolutionary times.
    *   **Less Seasonal Variation:** A more constant environment promotes niche specialization.
    *   **Higher Productivity:** Greater solar energy leads to higher productivity, supporting more life forms.

6.  **Direct Utilitarian Values:** These are the direct economic benefits derived from biodiversity. They include resources like food (cereals, fruits), medicines (quinine from Cinchona), industrial products (timber, rubber), and ecotourism.

7.  **Indirect Utilitarian Values:** These are the ecosystem services provided by biodiversity that are not directly harvested. They include pollination of crops by insects, climate regulation by forests, natural pest control, and water purification by wetlands.

8.  **Ethical Importance of Biodiversity:** This argument holds that every species has an intrinsic value and a right to exist, regardless of its economic worth to humans. We have a moral responsibility to protect all life forms and pass on our biological legacy to future generations.

9.  **Rivet Popper Hypothesis:** Proposed by Paul Ehrlich, this analogy compares an ecosystem to an airplane and species to its rivets. It suggests that while the initial loss of a few species (rivets) may not affect the ecosystem, the cumulative loss will eventually lead to a catastrophic collapse, especially if a keystone species (a critical rivet) is lost.

10. **Current Biodiversity Crisis:** The current rate of species extinction is estimated to be 100 to 1,000 times faster than the natural background rate seen in the fossil record. This accelerated loss is primarily driven by human activities and is often referred to as the sixth mass extinction.

11. **Habitat Loss and Fragmentation:** This is the primary driver of biodiversity loss. It involves the complete destruction of habitats (e.g., clearing the Amazon rainforest for agriculture) or the division of large habitats into smaller, isolated patches, which affects species with large territorial needs like tigers.

12. **Over-exploitation:** This occurs when humans harvest a species at a rate faster than it can naturally replenish. Examples include the overfishing of marine fish stocks and the hunting of the Passenger Pigeon and Steller's Sea Cow to extinction.

13. **Impact of Alien Species Invasions:** When non-native species are introduced, they can become invasive, outcompeting native species for resources, introducing diseases, or altering the habitat. The introduction of the Nile Perch into Lake Victoria led to the extinction of over 200 native cichlid fish species.

14. **Co-extinction:** This is the secondary extinction of a species that occurs when a species it depends on becomes extinct. For example, when a host fish species becomes extinct, its specific parasites also die out. Similarly, the extinction of a plant's sole pollinator will lead to the plant's extinction.

15. **Co-evolution and the Ophrys Example:** Co-evolution is the reciprocal evolutionary influence between interacting species. The Mediterranean orchid *Ophrys* demonstrates this by using sexual deceit. One of its petals has evolved to mimic a female bee, tricking the male bee into pseudocopulation, during which it inadvertently pollinates the flower. This specialized relationship means the orchid's survival is tied to the bee's survival.

16. **In Situ vs. Ex Situ Conservation:**
    *   **In Situ (On-site):** Conserving species within their natural habitats (e.g., national parks, wildlife sanctuaries). It preserves the entire ecosystem.
    *   **Ex Situ (Off-site):** Conserving species outside their natural habitats (e.g., zoos, botanical gardens, gene banks). It is used for endangered species that cannot be safely conserved in the wild.

17. **Methods of In Situ Conservation:** These include establishing protected areas like **National Parks** (strict protection), **Wildlife Sanctuaries** (some human activity allowed), and **Biosphere Reserves** (integrating conservation and sustainable use). **Sacred Groves**, protected by local communities, are another effective method.

18. **Methods of Ex Situ Conservation:** These include **Zoological Parks (Zoos)** and **Botanical Gardens** for breeding and public education. **Gene Banks** and **Seed Banks** store genetic material for future use, often using **Cryopreservation** (storage in liquid nitrogen at -196°C) to keep gametes and tissues viable for long periods.

19. **Biodiversity Hotspots:** These are regions characterized by exceptionally high levels of species richness and endemism (species found nowhere else) that are also under severe threat of habitat loss. To qualify, a region must contain at least 1,500 endemic vascular plant species and have lost at least 70% of its primary native vegetation.

20. **Indian Biodiversity Hotspots:** India has three major biodiversity hotspots:
    *   **Western Ghats and Sri Lanka:** Known for high endemism in amphibians and reptiles.
    *   **Indo-Burma:** Includes northeastern India, known for its diverse primate populations.
    *   **Himalaya:** Includes the entire Himalayan region, known for its unique alpine flora and fauna.

21. **Ramsar Convention:** It is an international treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of wetlands. It provides a framework for national action and international cooperation for the conservation of wetlands and their resources, recognizing their fundamental ecological functions and their economic, cultural, scientific, and recreational value.

22. **Red Data Book:** Maintained by the IUCN, the Red Data Book is a comprehensive inventory of the global conservation status of biological species. It uses a set of criteria to evaluate the extinction risk of thousands of species and subspecies, classifying them into categories like Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable, etc.

23. **Outcomes of the Earth Summit 1992:** The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro resulted in several key agreements. The most significant for biodiversity was the **Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)**, a legally binding treaty that called on all nations to conserve biodiversity, promote its sustainable use, and ensure the fair sharing of its benefits.

24. **Shannon Diversity Index (H):** The Shannon Diversity Index is a mathematical measure of species diversity in a community. It accounts for both species richness (the number of species) and species evenness (the relative abundance of species). A higher value of H indicates a more diverse community.

25. **Calculation:** Given `S = 10 * A^0.2` and A = 100 sq km.
    *   `S = 10 * (100)^0.2`
    *   `S = 10 * 2.51`
    *   `S ≈ 25.1`
    *   **Answer:** The species richness is approximately 25.

26. **If Z = 0.25, C = 5, and A = 400, calculate species richness.**
    *   `S = CA^Z`
    *   `S = 5 * (400)^0.25`
    *   `S = 5 * 4.47`
    *   `S ≈ 22.35`
    *   **Answer:** The species richness is approximately 22.

27. **Why Large Areas Have Higher Z-values:** Large areas, like continents, have steeper slopes (Z = 0.6 to 1.2) because they encompass a greater variety of habitats, climates, and geographical barriers. This environmental heterogeneity allows for more niche specialization and promotes the evolution of new species, leading to a more rapid increase in species richness as the area increases.

28. **Effects of Habitat Fragmentation:** Habitat fragmentation negatively impacts wildlife by reducing the total available habitat, creating smaller, isolated populations (which are more vulnerable to extinction), increasing "edge effects" (altered environmental conditions at the habitat boundary), and restricting movement and gene flow between populations, which is especially harmful for large, wide-ranging animals.

29. **Role of Nile Perch in Lake Victoria:** The intentional introduction of the Nile Perch, a large predatory fish, into Lake Victoria in the 1950s had a catastrophic ecological impact. It preyed upon the native cichlid fish, leading to the extinction of over 200 endemic species, drastically reducing the lake's biodiversity and disrupting its entire food web.

30. **Threat of Invasive Weeds in India:** Invasive weeds like *Parthenium* (carrot grass) and *Eichhornia* (water hyacinth) pose a significant threat to India's native biodiversity. They grow and spread aggressively, outcompeting native plant species for resources like sunlight, water, and nutrients. This can lead to a decline in native plant populations and affect the animals that depend on them.

31. **Host-Parasite Co-extinction:** This occurs when a parasite species is entirely dependent on a single host species for its survival. If the host species becomes extinct for any reason, the parasite, unable to survive on any other host, will also inevitably become extinct. This demonstrates the intricate web of dependencies in an ecosystem.

32. **Pollination in Ophrys Orchid:** The *Ophrys* orchid has a remarkable pollination mechanism based on sexual deceit. One of its petals has co-evolved to perfectly mimic the size, color, and markings of a female bee. The male bee, attracted by this mimicry, attempts to "pseudocopulate" with the flower, and in the process, pollen grains are transferred to its body, which it then carries to the next *Ophrys* flower it visits.

33. **National Parks vs. Wildlife Sanctuaries:**
    *   **National Parks:** These are strictly protected areas where no human activity, such as grazing, forestry, or cultivation, is permitted. They are established to protect the entire ecosystem, including the flora, fauna, and landscape.
    *   **Wildlife Sanctuaries:** These areas are also protected, but some human activities may be allowed as long as they do not interfere with the well-being of the wildlife. The focus is primarily on the conservation of specific animal species.

34. **Importance of Sacred Groves:** Sacred groves are patches of forest or natural vegetation that are protected by local communities due to their religious and cultural significance. They are vital for in-situ conservation, acting as refuges for numerous rare, endemic, and endangered species that have disappeared from surrounding areas. They represent a traditional form of community-based conservation.

35. **Process of Cryopreservation:** Cryopreservation is an ex-situ conservation technique used to preserve viable biological material (like seeds, gametes, or tissues) for very long periods. The material is stored at extremely low temperatures, typically in liquid nitrogen at -196°C. This ultra-low temperature halts all metabolic processes, preventing the cells from aging or dying.

36. **Criteria for Biodiversity Hotspots:** To be classified as a biodiversity hotspot, a region must meet two strict criteria:
    1.  It must have at least 1,500 species of vascular plants as endemics (species found nowhere else in the world).
    2.  It must have lost at least 70% of its original habitat.
    These criteria ensure that conservation efforts are focused on areas that are both rich in irreplaceable biodiversity and under severe threat.

37. **Western Ghats as a Hotspot:** The Western Ghats, along with Sri Lanka, form a major biodiversity hotspot. This region is characterized by exceptionally high levels of species richness and endemism, particularly for amphibians, reptiles, and fish. The forests of the Western Ghats are home to numerous threatened species, and the region faces significant pressure from human activities like agriculture, deforestation, and development projects.

38. **Importance of Wetlands:** Wetlands (like marshes, swamps, and bogs) are crucial for biodiversity conservation. They provide habitat for a wide variety of species, including many migratory birds. They also deliver vital ecosystem services, such as water purification, flood control, groundwater recharge, and shoreline stabilization, making their conservation essential for both wildlife and human well-being.

39. **IUCN Red List Categories:** The IUCN Red List is the world's most comprehensive inventory of the global conservation status of species. Key categories include:
    *   **Critically Endangered (CR):** Extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.
    *   **Endangered (EN):** Very high risk of extinction in the wild.
    *   **Vulnerable (VU):** High risk of extinction in the wild.
    *   **Near Threatened (NT):** Likely to become threatened in the near future.
    *   **Least Concern (LC):** Low risk of extinction.

40. **Concept of Ecosystem Services:** Ecosystem services are the multitude of benefits that ecosystems provide to humans, often free of charge. These services are crucial for human survival and well-being and include:
    *   **Provisioning services:** Food, water, timber.
    *   **Regulating services:** Climate regulation, pollination, pest control.
    *   **Cultural services:** Aesthetic, spiritual, and recreational benefits.
    *   **Supporting services:** Nutrient cycling, soil formation.

41. **Role of Pollinators:** Pollinators, such as bees, butterflies, birds, and bats, play a vital role in ecosystem functioning and agriculture. They are essential for the reproduction of most flowering plants, including a large proportion of the crops that provide our food. The decline of pollinators poses a serious threat to both biodiversity and food security.

42. **Importance of Seed Dispersal:** Seed dispersal is the movement or transport of seeds away from the parent plant. It is crucial for plant population dynamics, allowing plants to colonize new areas, avoid competition with the parent plant, and escape from pests and diseases that may be concentrated near the parent.

43. **Carbon Cycle and Biodiversity:** The carbon cycle is the process by which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, atmosphere, oceans, and geosphere. Biodiversity plays a key role, as plants and other photosynthetic organisms absorb CO2, storing carbon in their biomass. This process, known as carbon sequestration, helps regulate the global climate.

44. **Water Cycle and Biodiversity:** The water cycle (or hydrological cycle) describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. Biodiversity, particularly forests and wetlands, plays a crucial role by influencing rates of transpiration, infiltration, and runoff, thereby helping to regulate water flow, maintain water quality, and prevent floods and droughts.

45. **Nitrogen Cycle and Biodiversity:** The nitrogen cycle is the process by which nitrogen is converted between its various chemical forms. Biodiversity is essential for this cycle, with specific bacteria carrying out key processes like nitrogen fixation (converting atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia), nitrification, and denitrification. These processes make nitrogen available to plants, which is essential for their growth.

46. **Food Webs and Biodiversity:** A food web represents the feeding relationships within an ecosystem. High biodiversity leads to more complex and stable food webs. In a diverse ecosystem, if one species declines, the predator has alternative food sources, and the overall structure of the ecosystem is more likely to remain intact.

47. **Role of Decomposers:** Decomposers, such as bacteria and fungi, are critical for ecosystem health. They break down dead organic matter (dead plants and animals) and waste products, returning essential nutrients to the soil. This process of nutrient cycling makes these nutrients available for plants to use again, supporting the entire ecosystem.

48. **Importance of Soil Biodiversity:** Soil is a living ecosystem teeming with a huge diversity of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, insects, and worms. This biodiversity is vital for soil health, performing functions like nutrient cycling, decomposition of organic matter, and maintaining soil structure, which are all essential for plant growth and agriculture.

49. **Marine Biodiversity and Threats:** Marine biodiversity refers to the variety of life in oceans and seas. It is incredibly high but faces severe threats from overfishing, pollution (including plastics and chemical runoff), habitat destruction (e.g., coral reef bleaching), climate change (ocean acidification and warming), and invasive species.

50. **Freshwater Biodiversity and Conservation:** Freshwater ecosystems (rivers, lakes, wetlands) are hotspots of biodiversity but are among the most threatened ecosystems globally. Threats include pollution, dam construction, water extraction, and invasive species. Conservation requires integrated water resource management, pollution control, and protection of critical habitats.

51. **Forest Biodiversity and Values:** Forests are among the most biodiverse terrestrial ecosystems, providing habitat for a vast number of species. They provide essential ecosystem services like carbon sequestration, climate regulation, and water purification, as well as direct utilitarian values like timber, food, and medicinal plants.

52. **Grassland Biodiversity and Importance:** Grasslands support a unique assemblage of flora and fauna adapted to open, grassy environments. They are important for grazing animals, both wild and domestic, and play a role in carbon storage, primarily in their extensive root systems and soil organic matter.

53. **Desert Biodiversity and Adaptations:** Deserts, despite their harsh conditions, support a surprising amount of biodiversity. Species living in deserts have evolved remarkable adaptations to cope with extreme temperatures and lack of water, such as being nocturnal, having efficient water conservation mechanisms, and specialized reproductive strategies.

54. **Mountain Biodiversity and Altitudinal Gradients:** Mountain ecosystems exhibit high biodiversity, which changes with altitude, creating distinct ecological zones (altitudinal gradients). They are rich in endemic species due to their isolation. Mountains are also critical sources of water for downstream regions.

55. **Urban Biodiversity and Conservation:** Urban biodiversity refers to the variety of life within cities and towns. Green spaces like parks, gardens, and riverbanks can support significant biodiversity and provide important ecosystem services to urban dwellers. Conservation involves creating and connecting green spaces and promoting wildlife-friendly practices.

56. **Agricultural Biodiversity:** This includes all components of biological diversity that are relevant to food and agriculture. It encompasses the variety of crops and livestock (and their wild relatives), as well as the many organisms that support agricultural production, such as pollinators and soil microbes. It is essential for food security and resilient farming systems.

57. **Climate Change and Biodiversity:** Climate change is a major threat to biodiversity. Rising temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, and extreme weather events can alter habitats, shift species' ranges, and lead to mismatches in ecological relationships (e.g., between plants and their pollinators). Many species may not be able to adapt or move fast enough, leading to an increased risk of extinction.

58. **Ecological Restoration:** This is the practice of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed. It aims to restore the ecosystem's health, integrity, and sustainability. Activities can include reforestation, wetland creation, and the removal of invasive species.

59. **Community-Based Conservation:** This is an approach to conservation that actively involves local communities as key stakeholders in the management and protection of natural resources. It recognizes that local people have a vested interest in sustainable resource use and often possess valuable traditional knowledge. Examples include community-managed forests and sacred groves.

60. **Role of Education in Conservation:** Education and public awareness are crucial for biodiversity conservation. They can foster a sense of responsibility and stewardship towards the environment, promote sustainable behaviors, and build public support for conservation policies and actions. Informing people about the value of biodiversity and the threats it faces is a key first step.

61. **Economic Valuation of Biodiversity:** This involves assigning a monetary value to the goods and services provided by biodiversity and ecosystems. While controversial, it can be a powerful tool to highlight the economic importance of conservation and to make the costs of biodiversity loss more visible in policy and decision-making processes.

62. **Sustainable Use of Biodiversity:** This is one of the three main goals of the Convention on Biological Diversity. It means using the components of biological diversity in a way and at a rate that does not lead to their long-term decline, thereby maintaining their potential to meet the needs and aspirations of present and future generations.

63. **Role of Biotechnology in Conservation:** Biotechnology offers several tools for conservation. Techniques like DNA profiling and barcoding help in species identification and monitoring illegal trade. Gene banks and cryopreservation rely on biotechnological methods. Genetic engineering could potentially be used to increase the resilience of species to threats like disease.

64. **Importance of Ex Situ Facilities:** Ex situ facilities like zoos, botanical gardens, and seed banks play a critical role in conservation, especially for species on the brink of extinction. They provide a safe refuge, enable captive breeding programs to build up populations for potential reintroduction, and serve as important centers for research and public education.

65. **Challenges in Biodiversity Conservation:** Conservation faces numerous challenges, including insufficient funding, lack of political will, poverty and pressure on resources, climate change, the spread of invasive species, and the difficulty of monitoring and enforcing conservation laws. Addressing these requires a multi-faceted and collaborative approach.

66. **Role of International Cooperation:** Biodiversity is a global issue, as species and ecosystems do not respect national borders. International cooperation is essential for tackling transboundary issues like migratory species conservation, illegal wildlife trade, and climate change. Conventions like the CBD and CITES provide frameworks for countries to work together.

67. **Impact of Pollution on Biodiversity:** Pollution from various sources (industrial, agricultural, plastic) has severe impacts on biodiversity. Chemical pollutants can cause direct mortality or reproductive failure. Nutrient runoff (eutrophication) can lead to algal blooms that deplete oxygen in water bodies, killing fish. Plastic pollution can entangle and be ingested by wildlife.

68. **Ecological Corridors:** These are strips of habitat that connect larger, isolated patches of habitat. They are crucial for maintaining biodiversity in fragmented landscapes by allowing animals to move between patches to find food, mates, and new territories. This movement facilitates gene flow and helps prevent the local extinction of small populations.

69. **Role of Protected Areas:** Protected areas (like national parks and wildlife sanctuaries) are the cornerstones of biodiversity conservation. They are designated areas managed to protect specific ecosystems and species. By safeguarding critical habitats from destruction and disturbance, they provide a refuge for wildlife and allow natural ecological processes to continue.

70. **Importance of Wildlife Monitoring:** Monitoring wildlife populations and their habitats is essential for effective conservation. It allows conservationists to track population trends (e.g., whether a species is increasing or decreasing), assess the effectiveness of management actions, and detect new threats early. This information is vital for making informed conservation decisions.

71. **Concept of Adaptive Management:** This is a structured, iterative approach to conservation management that acknowledges uncertainty. It involves setting clear objectives, implementing management actions, monitoring the outcomes, and then using the results to adjust future actions. It is essentially "learning by doing" to improve conservation effectiveness over time.

72. **Role of Citizen Science:** Citizen science involves the public in scientific research, including biodiversity monitoring. Volunteers can collect large amounts of data over wide geographical areas that would be impossible for professional scientists to gather alone. This not only provides valuable data but also engages the public in conservation and increases scientific literacy.

73. **Importance of Taxonomic Studies:** Taxonomy, the science of identifying, naming, and classifying organisms, is fundamental to biodiversity conservation. We cannot conserve what we do not know. Taxonomic studies are essential to identify species, understand their relationships, and assess their conservation status, providing the basic knowledge needed for any conservation action.

74. **Concept of Phylogenetic Diversity:** This is a measure of biodiversity that incorporates the evolutionary relationships between species. Instead of just counting species, it considers how closely or distantly related they are. Conserving phylogenetic diversity means protecting a wider range of evolutionary history, which may also capture a greater variety of genetic and functional diversity.

75. **Role of Museums in Conservation:** Natural history museums are vast repositories of biological specimens, representing a snapshot of biodiversity through time. These collections are invaluable for taxonomic research, understanding historical species distributions, and studying genetic changes over time. Museums also play a key role in public education about biodiversity.

76. **Importance of Field Guides and Keys:** Field guides and identification keys are practical tools that help both scientists and citizens to identify species in their natural habitats. By making identification easier, they facilitate the collection of accurate data on species distribution and abundance, which is crucial for monitoring and conservation efforts.

77. **Concept of Ecological Indicators:** An ecological indicator is a species or a characteristic of an ecosystem whose status, trend, or change is used to assess the overall health of that ecosystem. For example, the presence of certain lichen species can indicate good air quality, while the decline of amphibians can signal broader environmental problems.

78. **Role of Flagship Species:** A flagship species is a charismatic species that is used as a symbol or ambassador for a conservation campaign. By focusing on a popular and appealing species like the giant panda or the tiger, conservation organizations can raise public awareness and funds for protecting not just that species, but also its entire habitat and the other species within it.

79. **Concept of Umbrella Species:** An umbrella species is a species whose conservation indirectly protects many other species that make up the ecological community of its habitat. These are typically large, wide-ranging species (like tigers or elephants). By protecting enough habitat to ensure the survival of the umbrella species, a large area is conserved, benefiting all the other species that live there.

80. **Importance of Habitat Connectivity:** Habitat connectivity refers to the degree to which the landscape allows animals to move between patches of habitat. In fragmented landscapes, maintaining and restoring connectivity through ecological corridors is vital. It allows for gene flow, recolonization of empty habitats, and helps species shift their ranges in response to climate change.

81. **Role of Fire in Maintaining Biodiversity:** In many ecosystems, such as grasslands and certain forests, fire is a natural and essential ecological process. These ecosystems are fire-adapted, and periodic fires help to maintain their structure and biodiversity by preventing the encroachment of other vegetation, releasing nutrients into the soil, and triggering the germination of certain seeds.

82. **Concept of Disturbance Ecology:** This is the study of how disturbances—events like fires, floods, storms, or disease outbreaks—affect the composition, structure, and function of ecosystems. While large, severe disturbances can be destructive, many ecosystems are adapted to a certain level of natural disturbance, which can increase biodiversity by creating a mosaic of different habitats.

83. **Importance of Migration Corridors:** Migration corridors are the routes that migratory species (like birds, whales, or wildebeest) follow between their breeding and non-breeding areas. Protecting these corridors is essential for the survival of these species, as they need safe passage and access to critical stopover sites for resting and feeding along their long journeys.

84. **Role of Traditional Knowledge:** Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) is the body of knowledge, practices, and beliefs about the relationship of living beings with one another and with their environment, held by indigenous and local communities. This knowledge, built over generations of direct interaction with the environment, can provide valuable insights for sustainable resource management and conservation.

85. **Concept of Biocultural Diversity:** This concept recognizes the link between biological diversity and cultural diversity. It highlights that the diversity of life is not just about species and ecosystems, but is also intertwined with the diversity of human cultures and languages. Conserving biodiversity and supporting indigenous cultures are often mutually reinforcing goals.

86. **Importance of Genetic Resources:** Genetic resources are the genetic material of plants, animals, and other organisms that is of value as a resource for present and future generations. This diversity is the raw material for evolution and adaptation, and it is crucial for developing new crop varieties, livestock breeds, and medicines.

87. **Role of Seed Banks in Conservation:** Seed banks are a type of gene bank that stores seeds as a source for planting in case seed reserves elsewhere are destroyed. They are a critical form of ex-situ conservation for plants, preserving the genetic diversity of crops and their wild relatives, which is essential for future food security and agricultural resilience.

88. **Concept of Tissue Culture in Conservation:** Plant tissue culture is a technique used to grow and propagate plant cells, tissues, or organs in a sterile, nutrient-rich medium. It is a valuable tool for the ex-situ conservation of plants, especially for species that are difficult to grow from seed or for rapidly multiplying rare and endangered plants for reintroduction programs.

89. **Importance of Captive Breeding Programs:** Captive breeding is the process of breeding animals in controlled environments like zoos and wildlife sanctuaries. It is a crucial ex-situ conservation tool for species whose populations are so low in the wild that they face imminent extinction. The goal is often to increase the population size so that individuals can be released back into their natural habitat.

90. **Role of Reintroduction Programs:** A reintroduction program involves releasing captive-bred or wild-collected individuals of a species into an area of their historical range from which they have been extirpated. It is a high-risk, complex conservation strategy aimed at re-establishing a viable population of the species in the wild.

91. **Concept of Translocation in Conservation:** Translocation is the deliberate movement of wild individuals or populations from one part of their range to another. It can be used to reinforce a declining population, re-establish an extinct one, or move a population out of an area where it is under severe threat.

92. **Importance of Habitat Restoration:** Habitat restoration is the process of returning a degraded habitat to its pre-degradation state. It is a vital conservation strategy because simply protecting remaining habitat is often not enough. Restoration can increase the area of available habitat, improve its quality, and enhance connectivity, thereby supporting larger and more resilient wildlife populations.

93. **Role of Invasive Species Management:** Managing invasive alien species is a critical component of biodiversity conservation. This can involve preventing the introduction of new invasive species, early detection and rapid response to eradicate new invaders, and long-term control and management of established invasive populations to reduce their impact on native species and ecosystems.

94. **Concept of Conservation Genetics:** This is an interdisciplinary science that applies genetic methods to the conservation and restoration of biodiversity. It uses genetic tools to understand issues like inbreeding, loss of genetic diversity, and gene flow in small populations, providing crucial information for managing threatened species and designing effective conservation strategies.

95. **Importance of Population Viability Analysis (PVA):** PVA is a quantitative method used to predict the likely future status of a population or a set of populations of a particular species. It uses demographic data and information on environmental factors to model the probability of a population persisting for a certain time. It is a powerful tool for assessing extinction risk and evaluating potential management options.

96. **Role of Landscape Ecology in Conservation:** Landscape ecology focuses on the spatial patterns of ecosystems and habitats and how these patterns affect ecological processes. In conservation, it is crucial for understanding the effects of habitat fragmentation and for designing effective conservation strategies at a large scale, such as creating protected area networks and ecological corridors.

97. **Concept of Metapopulations:** A metapopulation is a group of spatially separated populations of the same species which interact at some level. This concept is important in conservation because many species in fragmented landscapes exist as metapopulations. The long-term survival of the species may depend on the dynamics of extinction and colonization among these interconnected patches.

98. **Importance of Conservation Corridors:** Conservation corridors (or ecological corridors) are linear strips of habitat that connect larger blocks of habitat. They are a key strategy in landscape-scale conservation, designed to counteract the effects of habitat fragmentation. They facilitate movement, gene flow, and recolonization, making populations more resilient.

99. **Role of Conservation Planning:** Conservation planning is a systematic process of identifying, selecting, and designing conservation areas to meet specific biodiversity protection goals. It uses data on the distribution of species and habitats, as well as information on threats and costs, to make efficient and effective decisions about where to focus conservation efforts.

100. **Future Challenges in Conservation:** Future challenges in biodiversity conservation are immense. They include accelerating impacts from climate change, the increasing global demand for resources from a growing human population, the spread of new invasive species and diseases, and the need to make conservation relevant and beneficial to local communities. Addressing these will require innovative science, strong policies, and global cooperation.

## SECTION D: LONG ANSWER QUESTIONS - Answers

1.  **Concept and Types of Biodiversity:**
    Biodiversity, or biological diversity, is the vast variety and variability of life on Earth. It encompasses all levels of biological organization. The term was popularized by sociobiologist Edward Wilson. There are three main types:
    *   **Genetic Diversity:** This refers to the total number of genetic characteristics in the genetic makeup of a species. It is the variation of genes within a single species, which allows the species to adapt to changing environments. For example, the medicinal plant *Rauwolfia vomitoria* growing in different Himalayan ranges shows genetic variation in the potency and concentration of the active chemical reserpine it produces. Similarly, India has over 50,000 genetically different strains of rice and 1,000 varieties of mango.
    *   **Species Diversity:** This refers to the variety of different species within a given region. It is measured by species richness (the number of species per unit area) and species evenness (the relative abundance of individuals of different species). For instance, the Western Ghats have a far greater amphibian species diversity than the Eastern Ghats, indicating higher species richness in that region.
    *   **Ecosystem Diversity:** This is the variety of different ecosystems within a larger geographical area. It includes the diversity of habitats, biotic communities, and ecological processes. For example, India, with its diverse landscapes including deserts, rainforests, mangroves, coral reefs, wetlands, estuaries, and alpine meadows, exhibits a much greater ecosystem diversity than a country like Norway, which has a more uniform landscape.

2.  **Patterns of Biodiversity Distribution:**
    Biodiversity is not uniformly distributed across the globe. It follows distinct patterns, two of the most well-documented being the latitudinal gradient and the species-area relationship.
    *   **Latitudinal Gradient:** This is one of the most recognized patterns in ecology. It describes the general trend of decreasing species diversity as we move away from the equator towards the poles. Tropical regions (near the equator) are exceptionally rich in species compared to temperate and polar regions. For example, Colombia, located near the equator, has nearly 1,400 species of birds, while New York (41° N) has 105 species, and Greenland (71° N) only 56 species. This pattern is attributed to factors like the stable, predictable climate in the tropics, longer evolutionary time, and higher solar energy input leading to greater productivity.
    *   **Species-Area Relationship:** Observed by naturalist Alexander von Humboldt, this pattern shows that, within a region, species richness increases with increasing explored area, but only up to a certain limit. The relationship is represented by the equation `S = CA^Z`, where S is species richness, A is area, C is the Y-intercept, and Z is the slope of the line (regression coefficient). On a logarithmic scale, this relationship is a straight line (`log S = log C + Z log A`). The value of Z is typically 0.1-0.2 for small areas but becomes much steeper (0.6-1.2) for very large areas like entire continents, reflecting the greater variety of habitats over a larger geographical scale.

3.  **Species-Area Curve in Detail:**
    The species-area curve, proposed by Alexander von Humboldt, describes a fundamental relationship in ecology: the number of species found in an area increases as the size of that area increases.
    *   **Mathematical Representation:** The relationship is typically a rectangular hyperbola and can be described by the equation: `S = CA^Z`.
        *   `S` = Species richness
        *   `A` = Area
        *   `C` = Y-intercept (a constant that depends on the taxonomic group and region)
        *   `Z` = Slope of the line, or the regression coefficient.
    *   **Logarithmic Scale:** For easier analysis, the equation is often transformed into its logarithmic form, which yields a straight line: `log S = log C + Z log A`. In this form, `Z` is clearly the slope of the line.
    *   **Ecological Significance:** The value of the slope, `Z`, provides important ecological insights. For most taxonomic groups and regions, the `Z` value ranges from 0.1 to 0.2. However, for very large areas, like entire continents, the slope is much steeper, with `Z` values ranging from 0.6 to 1.2. This is because larger areas contain a greater diversity of habitats, leading to a more rapid accumulation of species. The `Z` value is also typically steeper for island ecosystems, reflecting the unique evolutionary processes and high endemism found there. This relationship is a crucial tool in conservation biology for predicting the number of species that would go extinct if a habitat were reduced in size.

4.  **Factors for Higher Tropical Biodiversity:**
    Ecologists propose several hypotheses to explain why tropical regions have significantly higher biodiversity than temperate or polar regions:
    *   **Longer Evolutionary Time:** Temperate regions were subjected to frequent glaciations in the past, which would have wiped out many species. Tropical latitudes have remained relatively undisturbed for millions of years, allowing for a longer period for species to evolve and diversify (speciation).
    *   **Stable and Predictable Environment:** Tropical environments are less seasonal, more constant, and predictable compared to temperate zones. This stability promotes niche specialization and leads to a greater number of species coexisting, as they can specialize on specific resources without the disruption of harsh seasons.
    *   **Higher Solar Energy and Productivity:** The tropics receive more solar energy, which leads to higher primary productivity. This greater availability of food and energy can support a larger number of individuals and more complex food webs, thus supporting a greater number of species.

5.  **Utilitarian Importance of Biodiversity:**
    The reasons for conserving biodiversity can be grouped into three categories: narrowly utilitarian, broadly utilitarian, and ethical.
    *   **Narrowly Utilitarian:** These arguments focus on the direct economic benefits that humans derive from nature. These include food (cereals, pulses, fruits), firewood, fiber, construction material, industrial products (tannins, lubricants, dyes, resins, perfumes), and products of medicinal importance. More than 25% of the drugs currently sold in the market worldwide are derived from plants, and 25,000 species of plants contribute to the traditional medicines used by native peoples around the world.
    *   **Broadly Utilitarian:** These arguments focus on the fundamental ecosystem services that biodiversity provides. The Amazon forest is estimated to produce, through photosynthesis, 20% of the total oxygen in the Earth’s atmosphere. Pollination, without which plants cannot give us fruits or seeds, is another service that ecosystems provide through pollinators like bees, bumblebees, birds, and bats. Other services include climate regulation, flood control, soil protection, and nutrient cycling.
    *   **Ethical Argument:** This argument relates to what we owe to the millions of plant, animal, and microbe species with whom we share this planet. It posits that every species has an intrinsic value, even if it may not be of any current economic value to us. We have a moral duty to care for their well-being and pass on our biological legacy in good order to future generations.

6.  **Rivet Popper Hypothesis:**
    Proposed by Stanford ecologist Paul Ehrlich, this hypothesis uses an analogy to explain the importance of every species in an ecosystem.
    *   **The Analogy:** An ecosystem is compared to an airplane, and the species within it are the rivets holding the airplane together.
    *   **The Process:** If a passenger pops a rivet from a seat (representing the extinction of a common species), the flight's safety may not be immediately affected. However, if every passenger starts popping rivets, the plane will become dangerously weak.
    *   **Keystone Species:** Furthermore, the loss of a rivet from a critical part, like the wing (representing the extinction of a keystone species), could lead to a catastrophic failure far more quickly than the loss of many rivets from the seats.
    *   **Implication:** The hypothesis implies that while the loss of a few species might not cause immediate ecosystem collapse, the cumulative loss of many species will eventually destabilize and destroy the ecosystem. It underscores the idea that every species has a role to play, and we may not know which species are the most critical until it's too late.

7.  **Current Biodiversity Crisis:**
    The world is currently experiencing a biodiversity crisis, often referred to as the sixth mass extinction.
    *   **Extinction Rates:** Fossil records show that the natural "background" rate of extinction is very slow. However, the current rates of species extinction are estimated to be 100 to 1,000 times higher than this background rate. This rapid loss is almost entirely due to human activities.
    *   **Recent Extinctions:** Numerous species have become extinct in recent history due to human actions. Examples include the dodo (a flightless bird from Mauritius, hunted to extinction), the quagga (a subspecies of zebra from Africa), the thylacine (the Tasmanian tiger), and Steller's sea cow. Three subspecies of tiger (Bali, Javan, Caspian) have also been lost.
    *   **Future Projections:** If current trends continue, scientists warn that more than half of all species on Earth could be wiped out within the next century. This represents a catastrophic and irreversible loss of biological wealth.

8.  **The Evil Quartet (Causes of Loss):**
    The accelerated rate of species extinction is driven by four major causes, collectively known as "The Evil Quartet":
    1.  **Habitat Loss and Fragmentation:** This is the most significant cause. As human populations expand, natural habitats are destroyed for agriculture, urbanization, and industry. The Amazon rainforest, for example, is rapidly being cleared. Fragmentation breaks large habitats into small, isolated patches, which is detrimental for animals with large territories and migratory habits.
    2.  **Over-exploitation:** Humans have always depended on nature, but when "need" turns to "greed," it leads to over-harvesting. This has led to the extinction of species like the Steller's sea cow and the passenger pigeon. Many marine fish populations are currently being overfished, threatening their survival.
    3.  **Alien Species Invasions:** When non-native species are introduced into an ecosystem, they can become invasive, outcompeting or preying on native species. The introduction of the Nile Perch into Lake Victoria led to the extinction of over 200 species of cichlid fish. Invasive plants like *Lantana* and *Eichhornia* also cause major damage to native ecosystems in India.
    4.  **Co-extinctions:** The extinction of one species can lead to the extinction of another species that depends on it. This is common in obligatory relationships, like a host-parasite pair or a plant and its specific pollinator. When the host or the plant becomes extinct, the species that depend on it also face extinction.

9.  **Habitat Loss and Fragmentation in Detail:**
    Habitat loss and fragmentation is the primary threat to biodiversity worldwide.
    *   **Habitat Loss:** This refers to the complete destruction of a natural habitat, rendering it unable to support the species that once lived there. The most dramatic example is the clearing of tropical rainforests, which hold a vast majority of the world's species. These forests are cut and cleared for cultivating soybeans or for conversion to grasslands for raising beef cattle.
    *   **Habitat Fragmentation:** This is the process by which a large, continuous area of habitat is both reduced in area and divided into two or more fragments. These patches are often isolated from each other by a matrix of human-modified landscapes. Fragmentation affects populations by reducing the total amount of available habitat, increasing isolation (which restricts gene flow), and creating "edge effects"—changes in environmental conditions at the boundary of the fragment that can be harmful to interior-dwelling species.

10. **Over-exploitation in Detail:**
    Over-exploitation occurs when a renewable resource is harvested at a rate that is unsustainable, meaning the population cannot replenish itself.
    *   **Historical Examples:** Many historical extinctions were due to over-exploitation. The passenger pigeon, once the most abundant bird in North America, was hunted to extinction for food. Steller's sea cow, a large marine mammal, was hunted to extinction within 27 years of its discovery.
    *   **Contemporary Examples:** Today, over-exploitation remains a major threat, particularly in marine ecosystems. Many commercial fish stocks, such as cod and tuna, are severely overfished, leading to population collapses. The illegal wildlife trade also drives over-exploitation of species like tigers (for their body parts), elephants (for ivory), and rhinos (for their horns).

11. **Alien Species Invasions in Detail:**
    An alien or exotic species is any species that is not native to an ecosystem. When these species are introduced, they can become invasive, spreading rapidly and causing harm to the native ecosystem.
    *   **Mechanisms of Impact:** Invasive species can outcompete native species for resources, prey on them, introduce new diseases, or alter the physical environment. They often thrive because they are free from the natural predators, parasites, and competitors that controlled their populations in their native range.
    *   **Case Studies:** A classic example is the introduction of the Nile Perch into Lake Victoria in East Africa. This large predator caused the extinction of more than 200 species of the lake's endemic cichlid fish. In India, the invasive weed *Parthenium* (carrot grass) has infested vast areas of agricultural and pasture land, while the African catfish (*Clarias gariepinus*), introduced for aquaculture, is threatening native catfish populations in rivers.

12. **Co-extinction and Co-evolution in Detail:**
    These two concepts illustrate the intricate interconnectedness of species within an ecosystem.
    *   **Co-evolution:** This is the process where two or more species reciprocally affect each other's evolution. A classic example is the relationship between a flowering plant and its pollinator. The plant evolves features to attract the pollinator, and the pollinator evolves features to efficiently extract resources from the plant. The Mediterranean orchid *Ophrys* exhibits a fascinating example of co-evolution, where one of its petals has evolved through sexual deceit to resemble a female bee to ensure pollination.
    *   **Co-extinction:** This is a direct consequence of co-evolution and interconnectedness. It refers to the phenomenon where the extinction of one species leads to the extinction of another. If the specific bee species that pollinates the *Ophrys* orchid were to become extinct, the orchid itself would also face extinction because it has no other means of pollination. Similarly, the extinction of a host species will inevitably lead to the extinction of its obligate parasites.

13. **In Situ vs. Ex Situ Conservation:**
    These are the two primary strategies for conserving biodiversity.
    *   **In Situ (On-site) Conservation:** This strategy focuses on conserving species in their natural habitats. It is generally considered the best approach because it protects the entire ecosystem and allows evolutionary processes to continue.
        *   **Methods:** National parks, wildlife sanctuaries, biosphere reserves, and sacred groves.
        *   **Advantages:** Protects the entire ecosystem, allows species to live in their natural environment, and is often more cost-effective for conserving a large number of species.
        *   **Limitations:** May not be sufficient for species that are critically endangered or whose habitats are completely lost.
    *   **Ex Situ (Off-site) Conservation:** This strategy involves conserving species outside of their natural habitats.
        *   **Methods:** Zoological parks (zoos), botanical gardens, wildlife safari parks, gene banks, seed banks, and cryopreservation.
        *   **Advantages:** Can be a last resort for species on the brink of extinction, allows for captive breeding to increase population numbers, and provides opportunities for research and public education.
        *   **Limitations:** Can be very expensive, only a small number of species can be conserved this way, and it does not protect the entire ecosystem from which the species came.

14. **Methods of In Situ Conservation:**
    In situ conservation is achieved by protecting natural habitats and ecosystems. The main methods include:
    *   **National Parks:** These are areas strictly reserved for the protection of wildlife and natural landscapes. No human activities like forestry, grazing, or cultivation are permitted. The focus is on preserving the entire ecosystem.
    *   **Wildlife Sanctuaries:** These areas are also protected, but with a focus on conserving specific species of animals. Some human activities, like timber harvesting and collection of minor forest products, may be permitted as long as they do not harm the wildlife.
    *   **Biosphere Reserves:** These are large, multi-purpose protected areas that aim to balance conservation with sustainable use. They have a core zone of strict protection, a buffer zone where limited human activity and research are allowed, and a transition zone where sustainable development is promoted.
    *   **Sacred Groves:** These are tracts of forest that have been protected by local communities for religious or cultural reasons. They are found in many parts of India and often harbor rare and endemic species, acting as small but vital refuges for biodiversity.

15. **Approaches to Ex Situ Conservation:**
    Ex situ conservation provides a crucial safety net for threatened species. The main approaches are:
    *   **Zoological Parks and Botanical Gardens:** These institutions maintain collections of animals and plants, respectively. They play a vital role in captive breeding programs for endangered species, as well as in research and public education about the importance of conservation.
    *   **Wildlife Safari Parks:** These are large, enclosed areas where animals are kept in a semi-natural environment, allowing for more natural behaviors than traditional zoos.
    *   **Gene Banks and Seed Banks:** These are facilities that preserve the genetic material of species. Seed banks store the seeds of different plant varieties, particularly crops and their wild relatives. Gene banks can also store gametes (sperm and eggs) of threatened animal species through cryopreservation.
    *   **Cryopreservation:** This technique involves preserving viable biological material (gametes, embryos, tissues) at ultra-low temperatures in liquid nitrogen (-196°C). This halts all metabolic activity, allowing the material to be stored for very long periods for future use in breeding programs.

16. **Concept of Biodiversity Hotspots:**
    The concept of biodiversity hotspots was developed to prioritize conservation efforts.
    *   **Definition:** A biodiversity hotspot is a biogeographic region that is both a significant reservoir of biodiversity and is under threat from human activities.
    *   **Criteria:** To qualify as a hotspot, a region must meet two strict criteria:
        1.  **High Endemism:** It must contain at least 1,500 species of vascular plants (>0.5% of the world's total) as endemics, meaning they are found nowhere else on Earth.
        2.  **High Threat Level:** It must have lost at least 70% of its original primary vegetation.
    *   **Global Distribution:** Initially, 25 hotspots were identified, but the number has since been increased to 36. These hotspots cover only 2.4% of the Earth's land surface, but they support more than half of the world's plant species as endemics and nearly 43% of bird, mammal, reptile, and amphibian species as endemics. This makes them critical priorities for global conservation.

17. **Indian Biodiversity Hotspots:**
    India is home to parts of three major global biodiversity hotspots:
    *   **Western Ghats and Sri Lanka:** This is a chain of mountains running along the western coast of India. The region is known for its exceptionally high levels of species richness and endemism, particularly in its amphibian, reptile, and fish species. The unique monsoon-driven climate has led to the evolution of a distinct and diverse flora and fauna, which is now under threat from agriculture and development.
    *   **Indo-Burma:** This hotspot includes a large part of Southeast Asia, including all of northeastern India (east of the Brahmaputra River). The region is characterized by a wide range of ecosystems, from subtropical forests to alpine scrub. It is known for its high diversity of freshwater turtles and primate species.
    *   **Himalaya:** This hotspot includes the entire Himalayan mountain range. It is characterized by dramatic altitudinal gradients, which create a wide variety of habitats and support a rich diversity of flora and fauna, including many unique alpine species. It is home to iconic species like the snow leopard and the red panda.

18. **Ramsar Convention and Wetland Conservation:**
    The Ramsar Convention, officially "The Convention on Wetlands of International Importance," is an international treaty dedicated to the conservation and wise use of wetlands.
    *   **Mission:** The convention's mission is "the conservation and wise use of all wetlands through local and national actions and international cooperation, as a contribution towards achieving sustainable development throughout the world."
    *   **Mechanism:** Countries that join the convention agree to designate at least one wetland as a "Ramsar Site" (a Wetland of International Importance) and to manage it to maintain its ecological character. They also commit to the "wise use" of all wetlands within their territory, which means integrating wetland conservation into their national planning.
    *   **Significance:** The convention is critically important because wetlands are among the world's most productive and biodiverse ecosystems, yet they are also among the most threatened. They provide essential habitats for countless species (especially migratory waterbirds) and deliver vital ecosystem services like water purification, flood control, and carbon storage.

19. **IUCN Red Data Book and Categories:**
    The Red Data Book, maintained by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), is the world's most comprehensive inventory of the global conservation status of plant and animal species.
    *   **Purpose:** Its primary purpose is to identify and document those species most in need of conservation attention and to provide a global index of the state of biodiversity.
    *   **Process:** It uses a rigorous set of criteria to evaluate the extinction risk of thousands of species. Based on this evaluation, species are assigned to one of several categories.
    *   **Key Categories:**
        *   **Extinct (EX):** No known individuals remaining.
        *   **Extinct in the Wild (EW):** Known only to survive in cultivation or captivity.
        *   **Critically Endangered (CR):** Facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.
        *   **Endangered (EN):** Facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild.
        *   **Vulnerable (VU):** Facing a high risk of extinction in the wild.
        *   **Near Threatened (NT):** Likely to qualify for a threatened category in the near future.
        *   **Least Concern (LC):** Widespread and abundant taxa.
        *   **Data Deficient (DD):** Not enough data to make an assessment of its risk of extinction.
    The Red List is a powerful tool that helps to guide conservation efforts and policy decisions worldwide.

20. **International Biodiversity Conventions:**
    Recognizing that biodiversity is a global asset, the international community has developed several key agreements to promote conservation.
    *   **The Earth Summit (Rio de Janeiro, 1992):** This was a landmark event that produced several important outcomes. The most significant was the **Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)**. This legally binding treaty has three main goals: the conservation of biodiversity, the sustainable use of its components, and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources.
    *   **The World Summit on Sustainable Development (Johannesburg, 2002):** At this summit, 190 countries pledged their commitment to achieve by 2010 a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss at the global, regional, and local levels. While this target was not fully met, it raised the political profile of biodiversity loss.
    *   **CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora):** This is another key international agreement that aims to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival.

21. **Mathematical Problem:**
    *   For A = 100 km²: S = 15 * (100)^0.3 ≈ 60 species.
    *   For A = 500 km²: S = 15 * (500)^0.3 ≈ 101 species.
    *   For A = 1000 km²: S = 15 * (1000)^0.3 ≈ 119 species.
    *   Percentage change (100 to 500 km²): ((101 - 60) / 60) * 100 = 68.33% increase.

22. **Shannon Diversity Index Calculation:**
    *   Total individuals = 100. Proportions: A=0.4, B=0.3, C=0.2, D=0.1.
    *   H = -[(0.4 * ln 0.4) + (0.3 * ln 0.3) + (0.2 * ln 0.2) + (0.1 * ln 0.1)]
    *   H ≈ -[(-0.366) + (-0.361) + (-0.322) + (-0.230)] = 1.279.
    *   Interpretation: H ≈ 1.28. For equal abundance (0.25 each), H ≈ 1.386. The calculated community has lower evenness than one with equal abundance.

23. **Habitat Loss and Species Richness:**
    Habitat loss reduces area (A), directly decreasing species richness (S) per S = CA^Z.
    If 75% of forest is cleared, 25% remains.
    Expected species loss = 1 - (0.25)^0.25 = 1 - 0.707 = 0.293.
    Percentage species loss ≈ 29.3%.

24. **Ecological and Economic Importance of Pollination Services:**
    *   **Ecological:** Essential for reproduction of most flowering plants, maintaining plant diversity and ecosystem stability.
    *   **Economic:** Crucial for over 75% of global food crops, contributing billions to agriculture.
    *   **Threats:** Pesticides, habitat loss, climate change, and diseases threaten pollinator populations, risking food security.

25. **Role of Forests in Carbon Sequestration and Climate Regulation:**
    Forests absorb vast CO2 via photosynthesis, storing carbon in biomass and soil, thus regulating climate. Biodiversity within forests enhances this capacity and overall ecosystem resilience.

26. **Concept of Ecosystem Services:**
    Ecosystem services are the benefits humans receive from ecosystems, vital for survival and well-being. They include provisioning (food, water), regulating (climate, pollination), cultural (recreation), and supporting (nutrient cycling) services.
