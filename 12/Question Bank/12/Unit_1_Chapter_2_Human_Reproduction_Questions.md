41. The male accessory ducts include the rete testis, vasa efferentia, epididymis, and vas deferens.
42. The rete testis is a network of tubules in the testis that collects sperms from the seminiferous tubules.
43. Vasa efferentia are small ducts that carry sperms from the rete testis to the epididymis.
44. The epididymis is a long, coiled tube located on the posterior surface of each testis, where sperms mature and are stored.
45. The vas deferens is a tube that carries sperms from the epididymis to the ejaculatory duct.

77. The fetal ejection reflex is a mild uterine contraction initiated by signals from the fully developed fetus and the placenta, which triggers the release of oxytocin.
78. Oxytocin stimulates the contraction of myoepithelial cells surrounding the alveoli in the mammary glands, leading to milk ejection (let-down reflex).
79. Breastfeeding provides optimal nutrition for the newborn, transfers antibodies from the mother (passive immunity), promotes bonding, and helps the mother's uterus to contract.
80. Spermatogenesis is the entire process of sperm formation from spermatogonia, while spermiogenesis is specifically the final stage where spermatids transform into mature spermatozoa.
81. Primary sexual characteristics are the reproductive organs themselves (testes, ovaries). Secondary sexual characteristics are external features that distinguish males and females but are not directly involved in reproduction (e.g., body hair, voice pitch).
82. The blood-testis barrier is a physical barrier formed by tight junctions between Sertoli cells, which protects developing sperm from the immune system and harmful substances in the blood.
83. Capacitation is the physiological maturation of sperm in the female reproductive tract, which enables them to fertilize an egg.
84. The cortical reaction is a process that occurs after a sperm binds to the egg, where cortical granules release enzymes that modify the zona pellucida, preventing polyspermy.
85. Polyspermy is the fertilization of an egg by more than one sperm, which is usually lethal for the embryo.
86. The zona pellucida is crucial in fertilization as it contains specific receptors for sperm binding and undergoes changes (cortical reaction) after the first sperm entry to block polyspermy.
87. A morula is a solid ball of cells (8-16 blastomeres), while a blastocyst is a hollow ball of cells with a fluid-filled cavity (blastocoel), an outer trophoblast, and an inner cell mass.
88. Gastrulation is the process during early embryonic development where the inner cell mass differentiates into three primary germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.
89. The three germ layers are significant because all the tissues and organs of the adult body develop from these specific layers.
90. The embryonic period is from fertilization to the end of the 8th week, during which major organs form. The fetal period is from the 9th week until birth, characterized by growth and maturation of organs.
91. Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone secreted by the trophoblast after implantation. It maintains the corpus luteum, ensuring continued progesterone secretion to support the pregnancy.
92. Morning sickness is nausea and vomiting that commonly occurs during the first trimester of pregnancy, often attributed to hormonal changes.
93. Quickening refers to the first fetal movements felt by the mother, usually occurring around the 5th month of pregnancy.

## Section C: 2 Marks Questions

1. A human sperm is a microscopic structure composed of a head, neck, middle piece, and tail. The head contains the haploid nucleus and is capped by the acrosome. The middle piece contains numerous mitochondria for energy, and the tail provides motility.
2. Leydig cells (interstitial cells) are located in the interstitial spaces outside the seminiferous tubules. They synthesize and secrete androgens, primarily testosterone, which is essential for spermatogenesis. Sertoli cells (nurse cells) are present inside the seminiferous tubules and provide nourishment to the developing sperms. They also secrete factors that help in spermiogenesis and form the blood-testis barrier.
3. Sperms are produced in the seminiferous tubules. From there, they move into the rete testis, then through the vasa efferentia to the epididymis, where they mature and are stored. From the epididymis, sperms are transported through the vas deferens, which joins with the duct of the seminal vesicle to form the ejaculatory duct. The ejaculatory duct then opens into the urethra, which carries sperms out of the body.
4. The male accessory glands (seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and bulbourethral glands) secrete seminal plasma. Seminal vesicles contribute fructose (energy for sperm), prostaglandins, and clotting proteins. The prostate gland secretes a milky, slightly acidic fluid that activates sperm. Bulbourethral glands secrete a lubricating fluid that neutralizes acidity in the urethra.
5. A human ovum (egg) is a large, non-motile, spherical cell. It is surrounded by a transparent, non-cellular zona pellucida and an outer layer of follicular cells called the corona radiata. It contains a large nucleus and abundant cytoplasm with stored nutrients.
6. Oogenesis begins during fetal development when oogonia (diploid germ cells) proliferate by mitosis. They then enter meiosis I and get arrested at prophase I, forming primary oocytes. These primary oocytes are then surrounded by granulosa cells to form primary follicles. No further oogonia are formed after birth.
7. During the follicular phase, under the influence of FSH, several primary follicles grow and develop. They transform into secondary follicles, then tertiary follicles (characterized by the fluid-filled antrum), and finally, one mature Graafian follicle. The growing follicles secrete estrogen.
8. Spermatogenesis is regulated by hormones from the hypothalamus, pituitary, and testes. GnRH from the hypothalamus stimulates the pituitary to release LH and FSH. LH acts on Leydig cells to secrete testosterone, which stimulates spermatogenesis. FSH acts on Sertoli cells to secrete factors that aid in spermiogenesis.
9. The menstrual cycle is regulated by GnRH from the hypothalamus, which stimulates the anterior pituitary to release FSH and LH. FSH primarily stimulates follicular growth and estrogen secretion. LH triggers ovulation and the formation of the corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone. Estrogen and progesterone, in turn, exert feedback control on GnRH, FSH, and LH.
10. Ovulation is triggered by a surge in LH (LH surge) around the middle of the menstrual cycle (day 14). The LH surge induces the rupture of the mature Graafian follicle, releasing the secondary oocyte from the ovary. It also initiates the transformation of the ruptured follicle into the corpus luteum.
11. The uterus undergoes cyclical changes during the menstrual cycle. In the menstrual phase, the endometrial lining breaks down and is shed. In the proliferative phase, under estrogen's influence, the endometrium regenerates and thickens. In the secretory phase, under progesterone's influence, the endometrium becomes highly vascularized and glandular, preparing for implantation.
12. Fertilization is the fusion of a sperm and an ovum, typically occurring in the ampulla of the fallopian tube. Sperm undergo capacitation in the female tract. Upon encountering the egg, the sperm undergoes an acrosome reaction, releasing enzymes to penetrate the corona radiata and zona pellucida. The sperm then fuses with the egg membrane, leading to the completion of meiosis II by the egg and the formation of a diploid zygote.
13. The acrosome reaction allows the sperm to release enzymes that digest the egg's outer layers (corona radiata and zona pellucida), enabling sperm penetration. The cortical reaction, triggered by sperm entry, involves the release of cortical granules that modify the zona pellucula, preventing any further sperm from entering (block to polyspermy).
14. Cleavage refers to the rapid mitotic divisions of the zygote as it moves through the fallopian tube. These divisions increase the number of cells (blastomeres) without increasing the overall size of the embryo. After 3-4 days, a solid ball of 8-16 blastomeres, resembling a mulberry, is formed, called the morula.
15. The morula continues to divide and develops into a blastocyst. The blastocyst is a hollow ball of cells with a fluid-filled cavity (blastocoel). It consists of an outer layer of cells called the trophoblast and an inner cell mass (embryoblast). The trophoblast helps in implantation, and the inner cell mass forms the embryo proper.
16. Implantation is the process by which the blastocyst attaches to and embeds itself in the endometrium of the uterus. This usually occurs about 7 days after fertilization. The trophoblast cells of the blastocyst adhere to the uterine wall and secrete enzymes that help it burrow into the endometrium.
17. The placenta is a temporary organ that forms during pregnancy, connecting the mother and the developing fetus. It is formed by the interdigitation of chorionic villi (from the fetus) and uterine tissue. Its functions include facilitating nutrient and oxygen exchange, waste removal, and hormone secretion like hCG, hPL, estrogen, and progesterone.
18. The umbilical cord is a flexible, tube-like structure that connects the fetus to the placenta. It contains two umbilical arteries (carrying deoxygenated blood and waste from fetus to placenta) and one umbilical vein (carrying oxygenated blood and nutrients from placenta to fetus). It is the lifeline between the mother and the developing baby.
19. Gastrulation is a critical process during early embryonic development where the inner cell mass differentiates and reorganizes to form the three primary germ layers: ectoderm (outer), mesoderm (middle), and endoderm (inner). These germ layers are fundamental as all tissues and organs of the adult body develop from them.
20. During the first trimester (weeks 1-12), major organ systems begin to form (organogenesis). The heart starts beating, limbs develop, and the brain and spinal cord form. The embryo transforms into a fetus by the end of this trimester, though it is still very small.
21. The second trimester (weeks 13-27) is characterized by rapid growth and maturation of organs. The fetus becomes more active, and the mother can feel its movements (quickening). Hair, eyelashes, and eyebrows appear. The sex of the baby can often be determined by ultrasound.
22. The third trimester (weeks 28-40) is primarily a period of rapid weight gain and final maturation of organs, especially the lungs. The fetus prepares for birth, turning into a head-down position. The mother experiences increased discomfort and prepares for labor.
23. Parturition is initiated by complex neuroendocrine mechanisms. Signals from the fully developed fetus and the placenta induce mild uterine contractions (fetal ejection reflex). This triggers the release of oxytocin from the maternal pituitary, which causes stronger uterine contractions, leading to labor.
24. Lactation is the production and secretion of milk by mammary glands. It is primarily regulated by prolactin, which stimulates milk synthesis, and oxytocin, which causes milk ejection (let-down reflex) in response to suckling. Breast milk provides complete nutrition and antibodies to the infant.
25. Colostrum is the first milk produced by the mother, rich in antibodies (IgA), proteins, and vitamins. It provides passive immunity to the newborn, protecting them from infections, and also helps in the development of the infant's digestive system.
26. Spermatogenesis is the continuous process of sperm formation in males, producing millions of sperms. Oogenesis is the discontinuous process of ovum formation in females, producing only one ovum per cycle. Spermatogenesis produces four functional gametes from one primary spermatocyte, while oogenesis produces one functional ovum and polar bodies from one primary oocyte.
27. The male reproductive system is designed for continuous sperm production and delivery, with external testes for temperature regulation. The female system is designed for cyclical egg production, fertilization, and nurturing a developing embryo/fetus internally. Both systems are hormonally regulated, but the patterns and specific hormones differ significantly.
28. Seminiferous tubules are highly coiled structures located within the testes. They are the sites of spermatogenesis, where sperm are produced. They are lined by spermatogonia and Sertoli cells.
29. The epididymis is a long, coiled tube located on the posterior side of each testis. It serves as the site for sperm maturation, where sperms acquire motility and fertilizing capacity. It also stores sperms before ejaculation.
30. The fallopian tubes (oviducts) are paired tubes extending from the uterus to near the ovaries. They consist of the infundibulum (funnel-shaped with fimbriae), ampulla (site of fertilization), and isthmus (narrow part joining uterus). They transport the ovum from the ovary to the uterus.
31. The uterus is a hollow, muscular, pear-shaped organ located in the pelvic cavity. Its primary function is to receive the fertilized egg, provide a site for implantation, and support the development of the embryo and fetus throughout pregnancy. Its muscular walls contract during parturition.
32. The ovary is the primary female sex organ, located in the pelvic cavity. It produces female gametes (ova) through oogenesis and secretes female sex hormones, estrogen and progesterone, which regulate the menstrual cycle and secondary sexual characteristics.
33. The hypothalamus secretes GnRH, which stimulates the anterior pituitary. The anterior pituitary then secretes FSH and LH. These gonadotropins act on the gonads (testes/ovaries) to stimulate gamete production and hormone secretion, forming a crucial part of the neuroendocrine regulation of reproduction.
34. In males, GnRH stimulates LH and FSH release. LH stimulates Leydig cells to produce testosterone. FSH and testosterone stimulate spermatogenesis. Testosterone and inhibin (from Sertoli cells) provide negative feedback to the hypothalamus and pituitary, regulating hormone levels.
35. In females, GnRH stimulates FSH and LH release. FSH stimulates follicular growth and estrogen secretion. LH triggers ovulation and corpus luteum formation, which secretes progesterone. Estrogen and progesterone provide negative feedback, but estrogen can also exert positive feedback leading to the LH surge.
36. The primary oocyte, arrested in Prophase I since fetal life, resumes meiosis I just before ovulation. It completes meiosis I, resulting in a large secondary oocyte and a small first polar body. The secondary oocyte then proceeds to Metaphase II and is released during ovulation.
37. If fertilization occurs, the corpus luteum persists due to hCG secreted by the trophoblast. It continues to secrete progesterone, maintaining the pregnancy. If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates after about 14 days, leading to a drop in progesterone and the onset of menstruation.
38. During the secretory (luteal) phase, under the influence of progesterone from the corpus luteum, the endometrium becomes highly vascularized, glandular, and thick. The endometrial glands secrete uterine milk, making the uterus receptive for implantation of the blastocyst.
39. Capacitation is a series of physiological changes that sperms undergo in the female reproductive tract (uterus and fallopian tubes) before they can fertilize an egg. These changes involve alterations in the sperm membrane that enable them to undergo the acrosome reaction and become hyperactive.
40. The block to polyspermy is a mechanism that prevents multiple sperms from fertilizing a single egg. It involves two main events: a fast block (depolarization of the egg membrane) and a slow block (cortical reaction), where enzymes released from cortical granules modify the zona pellucida, making it impenetrable to other sperms.
41. Blastulation is the process of forming a blastocyst from a morula. As the morula enters the uterus, fluid seeps into it, creating a central cavity called the blastocoel. The cells rearrange to form an outer trophoblast layer and an inner cell mass, thus forming the blastocyst.
42. The inner cell mass (embryoblast) of the blastocyst differentiates into the epiblast and hypoblast, forming a bilaminar embryonic disc. The epiblast gives rise to the three primary germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm) during gastrulation, which will form all the tissues and organs of the embryo.
43. The amniotic cavity forms within the epiblast, filling with amniotic fluid that cushions and protects the embryo. The yolk sac forms from the hypoblast and is involved in early blood cell formation and nutrient transfer before the placenta is fully functional.
44. The chorion is the outermost extraembryonic membrane, formed from the trophoblast and extraembryonic mesoderm. It develops chorionic villi that contribute to the placenta. The amnion is the inner membrane that encloses the amniotic cavity, providing a protective environment for the embryo.
45. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a glycoprotein hormone secreted by the trophoblast cells of the blastocyst after implantation. Its primary role is to maintain the corpus luteum, preventing its degeneration and ensuring the continued secretion of progesterone, which is essential for maintaining the uterine lining and preventing menstruation.
46. During pregnancy, the mother's body undergoes significant physiological changes. These include increased blood volume, cardiac output, and respiratory rate. The kidneys work harder, and the digestive system may experience nausea and constipation. Hormonal changes lead to breast enlargement and uterine growth.
47. Labor is divided into three stages. Stage 1 (dilation) involves regular uterine contractions that cause the cervix to efface (thin) and dilate (open). Stage 2 (expulsion) begins when the cervix is fully dilated and ends with the delivery of the baby. Stage 3 (placental) involves the delivery of the placenta after the baby is born.
48. Breastfeeding provides optimal nutrition for the baby, containing all necessary nutrients and antibodies for immunity. For the mother, it helps the uterus contract, reduces postpartum bleeding, and lowers the risk of certain cancers. It also promotes bonding between mother and baby.
49. Causes of male infertility can include low sperm count (oligospermia), poor sperm motility (asthenozoospermia), abnormal sperm morphology (teratozoospermia), blockages in the reproductive tract, hormonal imbalances, genetic factors, and lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking, excessive heat).
50. Causes of female infertility can include ovulatory disorders (e.g., PCOS), blocked fallopian tubes (due to PID or endometriosis), uterine abnormalities (e.g., fibroids), endometriosis, hormonal imbalances, and age-related decline in egg quality and quantity.
51. In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is an Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) where eggs are retrieved from the woman's ovaries and fertilized by sperm in a laboratory dish (in vitro). The resulting embryos are then cultured for a few days before being transferred into the woman's uterus.
52. Zygote Intrafallopian Transfer (ZIFT) is an ART where eggs are fertilized in vitro, and the resulting zygotes (fertilized eggs) are immediately transferred into the fallopian tube, allowing natural transport to the uterus for implantation.
53. Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer (GIFT) is an ART where eggs and sperm are collected and then directly transferred into the fallopian tube, allowing fertilization to occur naturally inside the woman's body. It requires at least one healthy fallopian tube.
54. Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) is a specialized IVF procedure where a single sperm is directly injected into an egg. It is particularly useful in cases of severe male infertility (e.g., very low sperm count or poor motility) or when previous IVF attempts have failed.
55. Ethical considerations in ART include the moral status of embryos, selective reduction (reducing the number of fetuses in multiple pregnancies), genetic screening of embryos, surrogacy, and the potential for designer babies. These raise complex questions about life, parenthood, and societal values.
56. Prostaglandins are lipid compounds that act like hormones. In reproduction, they are involved in various processes: they stimulate uterine contractions during menstruation and parturition, play a role in sperm motility, and are involved in ovulation and corpus luteum regression.
57. The blood-testis barrier is a physiological barrier formed by tight junctions between Sertoli cells, which protects developing sperm from the immune system and harmful substances in the blood.
58. Spermiation is the process by which mature spermatozoa are released from the Sertoli cells into the lumen of the seminiferous tubules. This is the final step of spermatogenesis before sperms are transported to the epididymis for maturation.
59. Inhibin is a hormone secreted by Sertoli cells in males (and granulosa cells in females). In males, it selectively inhibits the secretion of FSH from the anterior pituitary, providing a negative feedback mechanism to regulate spermatogenesis.
60. A mature ovarian follicle (Graafian follicle) is a large, fluid-filled structure containing a secondary oocyte. It consists of several layers of granulosa cells, a fluid-filled antrum, and two layers of theca cells (theca interna and theca externa).
61. If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates after about 14 days. It transforms into a small, white scar tissue called the corpus albicans, which marks the end of the luteal phase and leads to menstruation.
62. Menopause is characterized by a decline in ovarian function, leading to a decrease in estrogen and progesterone production. This results in elevated FSH and LH levels (due to lack of negative feedback) and the cessation of menstrual cycles.
63. Estrogen is the primary female sex hormone. It is responsible for the development of female secondary sexual characteristics (e.g., breast development, widening of hips), stimulates the growth and proliferation of the endometrium, and plays a role in bone density and cardiovascular health.
64. Progesterone is a steroid hormone primarily secreted by the corpus luteum. Its main role is to prepare and maintain the uterine lining (endometrium) for implantation and pregnancy. It also inhibits uterine contractions and suppresses the immune response to the fetus.
65. Relaxin is a hormone produced by the corpus luteum and placenta during pregnancy. It helps to relax the ligaments in the pelvis and soften the cervix, making it easier for the baby to pass through the birth canal during parturition.
66. Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent cells derived from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst. They have the ability to differentiate into any cell type of the body. Their differentiation is guided by specific growth factors and signaling molecules in their environment.
67. Totipotency is the ability of a single cell (like a zygote) to differentiate into all cell types, including extraembryonic tissues. Pluripotency is the ability of a cell (like an embryonic stem cell) to differentiate into all cell types of the three germ layers, but not extraembryonic tissues.
68. The neural tube develops from the ectoderm during neurulation. It forms the brain and spinal cord. Defects in neural tube closure can lead to conditions like spina bifida.
69. Somites are segmented blocks of mesoderm that form along the neural tube. They differentiate into various structures, including vertebrae, ribs, skeletal muscles of the trunk and limbs, and dermis of the skin.
70. The heart begins to develop from mesoderm cells around the third week of gestation. It starts as a simple tube that folds and septates to form the four-chambered heart, becoming functional and beginning to beat by the fourth week.
71. Limb buds appear around the fourth week of gestation. They develop from the lateral plate mesoderm and are patterned by signaling molecules like FGF and Sonic Hedgehog, leading to the formation of bones, muscles, and connective tissues of the upper and lower limbs.
72. The face develops from five facial prominences that fuse during the 4th to 10th weeks of gestation. Failure of these prominences to fuse properly can result in congenital anomalies like cleft lip and palate.
73. The brain develops from the anterior part of the neural tube. It undergoes rapid growth and differentiation, forming the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain, which further develop into the cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, and other structures.
74. The eyes develop from outgrowths of the forebrain (optic vesicles) and ectoderm. The ears develop from ectodermal thickenings (otic placodes) that invaginate to form the inner ear, while the middle and outer ear develop from pharyngeal arches.
75. The digestive system develops from the endoderm, forming the primitive gut tube. Outgrowths from this tube give rise to organs like the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder. The mesoderm forms the muscular and connective tissue layers of the gut wall.
76. The respiratory system develops as an outgrowth from the foregut endoderm. The trachea, bronchi, and lungs form from this outgrowth, undergoing extensive branching and differentiation to form the complex alveolar structure necessary for gas exchange.
77. The urinary system develops from the intermediate mesoderm. The kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra form sequentially, with the kidneys becoming functional and producing urine by the end of the first trimester.
78. The reproductive organs develop from the intermediate mesoderm and primordial germ cells. Initially, both male and female embryos have indifferent gonads. The presence or absence of the SRY gene on the Y chromosome determines whether the gonad develops into a testis or an ovary.
79. Sex determination in humans is chromosomal. Individuals with XX chromosomes are typically female, and those with XY chromosomes are typically male. The presence of the SRY gene on the Y chromosome is the key factor that triggers male development.
80. The SRY (Sex-determining Region Y) gene is located on the Y chromosome. Its presence initiates the development of the indifferent gonad into a testis. In the absence of SRY, the gonad develops into an ovary.
81. Fraternal (dizygotic) twins result from the fertilization of two separate eggs by two separate sperms. They are genetically as similar as any other siblings. Identical (monozygotic) twins result from the splitting of a single fertilized egg (zygote) into two embryos. They are genetically identical.
82. Conjoined twins occur when a single fertilized egg fails to completely separate into two distinct embryos during early development. The extent of fusion varies, leading to different types of conjoined twins depending on which body parts are shared.
83. Ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, most commonly in the fallopian tube. It can also occur in the ovary, abdomen, or cervix. It is a medical emergency as the pregnancy cannot survive and can cause severe internal bleeding.
84. Preeclampsia is a serious pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to another organ system, most often the liver and kidneys. Symptoms include severe headaches, vision changes, and swelling. It can lead to eclampsia, which involves seizures.
85. Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy in women who did not have diabetes before. It is caused by insulin resistance due to pregnancy hormones. Symptoms are often mild, but it can lead to complications for both mother and baby if not managed.
86. Prenatal care is essential for a healthy pregnancy outcome. It involves regular medical check-ups, monitoring maternal and fetal health, nutritional counseling, screening for potential complications, and preparing for childbirth. It helps detect and manage issues early.
87. Birth control methods include hormonal methods (pills, patches, injections, implants), barrier methods (condoms, diaphragms), intrauterine devices (IUDs), natural family planning, and permanent methods (vasectomy, tubal ligation).
88. Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) primarily work by releasing synthetic estrogen and progesterone, which inhibit the release of FSH and LH from the pituitary. This prevents ovulation and also thickens cervical mucus (blocking sperm) and thins the uterine lining (preventing implantation).
89. Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are small, T-shaped devices inserted into the uterus. Hormonal IUDs release progestin, which thickens cervical mucus and thins the uterine lining. Copper IUDs cause an inflammatory reaction in the uterus that is toxic to sperm and eggs, preventing fertilization and implantation.
90. Vasectomy is a permanent male birth control method. It involves surgically cutting or sealing the vas deferens, which are the tubes that carry sperm from the testes. This prevents sperm from mixing with semen during ejaculation, making the man sterile.
91. Tubal ligation is a permanent female birth control method. It involves surgically cutting, tying, or sealing the fallopian tubes. This prevents eggs from traveling from the ovaries to the uterus and blocks sperm from reaching the egg, thus preventing fertilization.
92. Common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) include Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Syphilis, Herpes, HPV (Human Papillomavirus), and HIV/AIDS. They are spread primarily through sexual contact.
93. Methods of preventing STIs include abstinence, consistent and correct use of condoms, limiting the number of sexual partners, getting tested regularly, and vaccination (e.g., for HPV).
94. Chlamydia is a common bacterial STI. Symptoms are often mild or absent, but can include abnormal discharge, painful urination, and pelvic pain. Untreated Chlamydia can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women, causing infertility and ectopic pregnancy.
95. Gonorrhea is a bacterial STI. Symptoms can include painful urination, abnormal discharge, and pelvic pain. Like Chlamydia, untreated Gonorrhea can lead to PID, infertility, and can also affect joints, heart, and other body parts.
96. Syphilis is a bacterial STI that progresses through stages. Primary syphilis involves a painless sore (chancre). Secondary syphilis involves a rash and flu-like symptoms. Tertiary syphilis can cause severe damage to the heart, brain, and other organs. It is curable with antibiotics.
97. Herpes is a viral STI caused by HSV. It causes painful blisters and sores, primarily on the genitals or mouth. It is a lifelong infection, with recurrent outbreaks. There is no cure, but antiviral medications can manage symptoms and reduce outbreaks.
98. HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a viral infection that attacks the immune system. AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) is the late stage of HIV infection. HIV is transmitted through specific body fluids. There is no cure, but antiretroviral therapy can manage the virus and prevent progression to AIDS.
99. Sexual health education is crucial for empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their sexual health. It provides knowledge about anatomy, reproduction, contraception, STIs, consent, and healthy relationships, promoting responsible sexual behavior and well-being.
100. Ethical considerations in human reproduction include issues like access to ART, genetic selection, surrogacy, embryo research, and the rights of gamete donors and offspring. These topics often involve balancing individual autonomy with societal values and moral principles.

8. The female primary sex organ is the ovary.
9. Fimbriae are finger-like projections at the edge of the infundibulum (part of the fallopian tube) that help collect the ovum after ovulation.
10. The uterus is also known as the womb.
11. Menstruation is the monthly shedding of the uterine lining (endometrium) in females, occurring if fertilization does not take place.
12. Ovulation is the release of a mature ovum (secondary oocyte) from the Graafian follicle of the ovary.
13. The main hormones involved in the regulation of the menstrual cycle are GnRH, FSH, LH, estrogen, and progesterone.

15. Gestation period is the duration of pregnancy, from conception to birth, approximately 9 months (280 days) in humans.
16. Parturition is the process of childbirth, the expulsion of the fully developed fetus from the uterus.
17. Colostrum is the yellowish, antibody-rich fluid secreted by the mammary glands during the first few days after childbirth, providing immunity to the newborn.
18. The seminiferous tubules are lined by spermatogonia (sperm-forming cells) and Sertoli cells (nurse cells).
19. Sertoli cells provide nourishment to the developing sperms and secrete some hormones like inhibin.
20. The acrosome is a cap-like structure at the head of the sperm, containing hydrolytic enzymes (e.g., hyaluronidase, acrosin) essential for penetrating the egg during fertilization.
21. The middle piece of the sperm contains numerous mitochondria, which provide the energy for the movement of the sperm tail, essential for motility.
22. Oogenesis is the process of formation of a mature female gamete (ovum) from oogonia in the ovaries.
23. A Graafian follicle is the mature ovarian follicle, containing the secondary oocyte, ready for ovulation.
24. The corpus luteum is a temporary endocrine structure formed from the ruptured Graafian follicle after ovulation, which secretes progesterone.
25. The menstrual cycle consists of four phases: menstrual phase, follicular (proliferative) phase, ovulatory phase, and luteal (secretory) phase.
26. The LH surge is a rapid increase in Luteinizing Hormone (LH) secretion that triggers ovulation and the formation of the corpus luteum.
27. The zona pellucida is a non-cellular, transparent outer layer secreted by the secondary oocyte, which plays a crucial role in fertilization.
28. Cleavage refers to the rapid mitotic divisions of the zygote without significant growth in size, leading to the formation of a multicellular embryo.
29. A morula is a solid ball of 8-16 blastomeres (cells) formed during the early stages of embryonic development, resembling a mulberry.
30. A blastocyst is the embryonic stage that follows the morula, characterized by a fluid-filled cavity (blastocoel), an outer trophoblast layer, and an inner cell mass.
31. The trophoblast is the outer layer of cells of the blastocyst, which helps in implantation and forms the fetal part of the placenta.
32. The inner cell mass (embryoblast) is a cluster of cells within the blastocyst that differentiates to form the embryo proper.
33. Chorionic villi are finger-like projections that appear on the trophoblast after implantation, which interdigitate with uterine tissue to form the placenta.
34. The placenta serves as a structural and functional unit between the developing embryo (fetus) and the maternal body, facilitating nutrient supply, oxygen exchange, waste removal, and hormone secretion.
35. Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone secreted by the placenta, which maintains the corpus luteum and thus the pregnancy.
36. The amnion is a membrane that forms a fluid-filled sac (amniotic cavity) around the embryo, protecting it from shock and desiccation.
37. The umbilical cord is a cord-like structure that connects the fetus to the placenta, containing umbilical arteries and veins for exchange of substances.
38. The three germ layers formed during gastrulation are the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.
39. Organogenesis is the process of formation and development of various organs and organ systems from the three primary germ layers during embryonic development.
40. Lactation is the process of milk production and secretion by the mammary glands after childbirth.
41. The male accessory ducts include the rete testis, vasa efferentia, epididymis, and vas deferens.
42. The rete testis is a network of tubules in the testis that collects sperms from the seminiferous tubules.
43. Vasa efferentia are small ducts that carry sperms from the rete testis to the epididymis.
44. The epididymis is a long, coiled tube located on the posterior surface of each testis, where sperms mature and are stored.
45. The vas deferens is a tube that carries sperms from the epididymis to the ejaculatory duct.
46. The ejaculatory duct is formed by the union of the vas deferens and the duct of the seminal vesicle, opening into the urethra.
47. In males, the urethra serves as a common passage for both urine and semen.
48. The female external genitalia (vulva) include the mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, hymen, and clitoris.
49. The mons pubis is a cushion of fatty tissue covered by skin and pubic hair, located above the labia majora.
50. Labia majora are fleshy folds of tissue, which extend down from the mons pubis and surround the vaginal opening.
51. Labia minora are paired folds of tissue located under the labia majora.
52. The hymen is a membrane that partially covers the opening of the vagina.
53. The clitoris is a tiny, finger-like erectile structure located at the upper junction of the two labia minora, homologous to the penis.
54. Mammary glands are paired structures (breasts) that contain glandular tissue and variable amounts of fat, responsible for milk production.
55. Menarche is the first menstruation, which begins at puberty in females.
56. Menopause is the cessation of menstruation, typically occurring around 45-50 years of age in females.
57. A primary follicle consists of a primary oocyte surrounded by a single layer of granulosa cells.
58. A secondary follicle is formed when the primary follicle gets surrounded by more layers of granulosa cells and a new theca layer.
59. A tertiary follicle is characterized by the presence of a fluid-filled cavity called the antrum.
60. The antrum is the fluid-filled cavity that develops within the tertiary follicle.
61. The corona radiata is a layer of follicular cells that surrounds the zona pellucida of the ovum after ovulation.
62. The first polar body is a small, non-functional cell formed during the first meiotic division of the primary oocyte, which receives very little cytoplasm.
63. The second polar body is a small, non-functional cell formed during the second meiotic division of the secondary oocyte, which also receives very little cytoplasm.
64. Unequal cytokinesis in oogenesis ensures that the ovum receives almost all the cytoplasm and nutrients, while the polar bodies receive very little, making the ovum large and nutrient-rich.
65. In males, FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) acts on Sertoli cells and stimulates the secretion of factors that help in spermatogenesis.
66. In males, LH (Luteinizing Hormone) acts on Leydig cells and stimulates the synthesis and secretion of androgens (testosterone).
67. In females, FSH stimulates the growth and development of ovarian follicles.
68. In females, LH stimulates ovulation and the formation of the corpus luteum.
69. Estrogen, secreted by growing follicles, stimulates the proliferation of the endometrium and the development of female secondary sexual characteristics.
70. Progesterone, secreted by the corpus luteum, maintains the endometrium for implantation and pregnancy.
71. The corpus luteum is crucial for maintaining pregnancy by secreting progesterone, which is essential for the maintenance of the uterine lining.
72. If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates, leading to a sharp fall in progesterone levels, which causes the disintegration of the endometrium and menstruation.
73. During pregnancy, the corpus luteum persists and continues to secrete progesterone under the influence of hCG (human Chorionic Gonadotropin) from the placenta.
74. The decidua is the modified endometrium of the uterus during pregnancy, which forms the maternal part of the placenta.
75. The umbilical arteries carry deoxygenated blood and waste products from the fetus to the placenta, while the umbilical vein carries oxygenated blood and nutrients from the placenta to the fetus.
76. Relaxin is a hormone secreted by the ovary and placenta during pregnancy, which relaxes the pelvic ligaments and widens the cervix to facilitate parturition.
77. The fetal ejection reflex is a mild uterine contraction initiated by signals from the fully developed fetus and the placenta, which triggers the release of oxytocin.
78. Oxytocin stimulates the contraction of myoepithelial cells surrounding the alveoli in the mammary glands, leading to milk ejection (let-down reflex).
79. Breastfeeding provides optimal nutrition for the newborn, transfers antibodies from the mother (passive immunity), promotes bonding, and helps the mother's uterus to contract.
80. Spermatogenesis is the entire process of sperm formation from spermatogonia, while spermiogenesis is specifically the final stage where spermatids transform into mature spermatozoa.
81. Primary sexual characteristics are the reproductive organs themselves (testes, ovaries). Secondary sexual characteristics are external features that distinguish males and females but are not directly involved in reproduction (e.g., body hair, voice pitch).
82. The blood-testis barrier is a physical barrier formed by tight junctions between Sertoli cells, which protects developing sperm from the immune system and harmful substances in the blood.
83. Capacitation is the physiological maturation of sperm in the female reproductive tract, which enables them to fertilize an egg.
84. The cortical reaction is a process that occurs after a sperm binds to the egg, where cortical granules release enzymes that modify the zona pellucida, preventing polyspermy.
85. Polyspermy is the fertilization of an egg by more than one sperm, which is usually lethal for the embryo.
86. The zona pellucida is crucial in fertilization as it contains specific receptors for sperm binding and undergoes changes (cortical reaction) after the first sperm entry to block polyspermy.
87. A morula is a solid ball of cells (8-16 blastomeres), while a blastocyst is a hollow ball of cells with a fluid-filled cavity (blastocoel), an outer trophoblast, and an inner cell mass.
88. Gastrulation is the process during early embryonic development where the inner cell mass differentiates into three primary germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.
89. The three germ layers are significant because all the tissues and organs of the adult body develop from these specific layers.
90. The embryonic period is from fertilization to the end of the 8th week, during which major organs form. The fetal period is from the 9th week until birth, characterized by growth and maturation of organs.
91. Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone secreted by the trophoblast after implantation. It maintains the corpus luteum, ensuring continued progesterone secretion to support the pregnancy.
92. Morning sickness is nausea and vomiting that commonly occurs during the first trimester of pregnancy, often attributed to hormonal changes.
93. Quickening refers to the first fetal movements felt by the mother, usually occurring around the 5th month of pregnancy.
94. True labor involves regular, strong uterine contractions that lead to cervical dilation and effacement. False labor (Braxton Hicks contractions) are irregular, weaker contractions that do not cause cervical changes.
95. The stages of labor are: 1. Dilation (cervix dilates). 2. Expulsion (fetus is delivered). 3. Placental (placenta is expelled).
96. Episiotomy is a surgical incision made in the perineum (area between vagina and anus) during childbirth to enlarge the vaginal opening and prevent tearing.
97. A Cesarean section (C-section) is a surgical procedure to deliver the baby through an incision in the mother's abdomen and uterus.
98. Infertility is the inability to conceive after 12 months of regular, unprotected intercourse.
99. Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) are medical procedures used to help infertile couples conceive, such as IVF, ZIFT, GIFT, and ICSI.
100. IVF-ET (In Vitro Fertilization and Embryo Transfer) is an ART where fertilization occurs outside the body (in vitro), and the resulting embryo is transferred into the uterus.

## Section C: 2 Marks Questions

1. A human sperm is a microscopic structure composed of a head, neck, middle piece, and tail. The head contains the haploid nucleus and is capped by the acrosome. The middle piece contains numerous mitochondria for energy, and the tail provides motility.
2. Leydig cells (interstitial cells) are located in the interstitial spaces outside the seminiferous tubules. They synthesize and secrete androgens, primarily testosterone, which is essential for spermatogenesis. Sertoli cells (nurse cells) are present inside the seminiferous tubules and provide nourishment to the developing sperms. They also secrete factors that help in spermiogenesis and form the blood-testis barrier.
3. Sperms are produced in the seminiferous tubules. From there, they move into the rete testis, then through the vasa efferentia to the epididymis, where they mature and are stored. From the epididymis, sperms are transported through the vas deferens, which joins with the duct of the seminal vesicle to form the ejaculatory duct. The ejaculatory duct then opens into the urethra, which carries sperms out of the body.
4. The male accessory glands (seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and bulbourethral glands) secrete seminal plasma. Seminal vesicles contribute fructose (energy for sperm), prostaglandins, and clotting proteins. The prostate gland secretes a milky, slightly acidic fluid that activates sperm. Bulbourethral glands secrete a lubricating fluid that neutralizes acidity in the urethra.
5. A human ovum (egg) is a large, non-motile, spherical cell. It is surrounded by a transparent, non-cellular zona pellucida and an outer layer of follicular cells called the corona radiata. It contains a large nucleus and abundant cytoplasm with stored nutrients.
6. Oogenesis begins during fetal development when oogonia (diploid germ cells) proliferate by mitosis. They then enter meiosis I and get arrested at prophase I, forming primary oocytes. These primary oocytes are then surrounded by granulosa cells to form primary follicles. No further oogonia are formed after birth.
7. During the follicular phase, under the influence of FSH, several primary follicles grow and develop. They transform into secondary follicles, then tertiary follicles (characterized by the fluid-filled antrum), and finally, one mature Graafian follicle. The growing follicles secrete estrogen.
8. Spermatogenesis is regulated by hormones from the hypothalamus, pituitary, and testes. GnRH from the hypothalamus stimulates the pituitary to release LH and FSH. LH acts on Leydig cells to secrete testosterone, which stimulates spermatogenesis. FSH acts on Sertoli cells to secrete factors that aid in spermiogenesis.
9. The menstrual cycle is regulated by GnRH from the hypothalamus, which stimulates the anterior pituitary to release FSH and LH. FSH primarily stimulates follicular growth and estrogen secretion. LH triggers ovulation and the formation of the corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone. Estrogen and progesterone, in turn, exert feedback control on GnRH, FSH, and LH.
10. Ovulation is triggered by a surge in LH (LH surge) around the middle of the menstrual cycle (day 14). The LH surge induces the rupture of the mature Graafian follicle, releasing the secondary oocyte from the ovary. It also initiates the transformation of the ruptured follicle into the corpus luteum.
11. The uterus undergoes cyclical changes during the menstrual cycle. In the menstrual phase, the endometrial lining breaks down and is shed. In the proliferative phase, under estrogen's influence, the endometrium regenerates and thickens. In the secretory phase, under progesterone's influence, the endometrium becomes highly vascularized and glandular, preparing for implantation.
12. Fertilization is the fusion of a sperm and an ovum, typically occurring in the ampulla of the fallopian tube. Sperm undergo capacitation in the female tract. Upon encountering the egg, the sperm undergoes an acrosome reaction, releasing enzymes to penetrate the corona radiata and zona pellucida. The sperm then fuses with the egg membrane, leading to the completion of meiosis II by the egg and the formation of a diploid zygote.
13. The acrosome reaction allows the sperm to release enzymes that digest the egg's outer layers (corona radiata and zona pellucida), enabling sperm penetration. The cortical reaction, triggered by sperm entry, involves the release of cortical granules that modify the zona pellucula, preventing any further sperm from entering (block to polyspermy).
14. Cleavage refers to the rapid mitotic divisions of the zygote as it moves through the fallopian tube. These divisions increase the number of cells (blastomeres) without increasing the overall size of the embryo. After 3-4 days, a solid ball of 8-16 blastomeres, resembling a mulberry, is formed, called the morula.
15. The morula continues to divide and develops into a blastocyst. The blastocyst is a hollow ball of cells with a fluid-filled cavity (blastocoel). It consists of an outer layer of cells called the trophoblast and an inner cell mass (embryoblast). The trophoblast helps in implantation, and the inner cell mass forms the embryo proper.
16. Implantation is the process by which the blastocyst attaches to and embeds itself in the endometrium of the uterus. This usually occurs about 7 days after fertilization. The trophoblast cells of the blastocyst adhere to the uterine wall and secrete enzymes that help it burrow into the endometrium.
17. The placenta is a temporary organ that forms during pregnancy, connecting the mother and the developing fetus. It is formed by the interdigitation of chorionic villi (from the fetus) and uterine tissue. Its functions include facilitating nutrient and oxygen exchange, waste removal, and hormone secretion like hCG, hPL, estrogen, and progesterone.
18. The umbilical cord is a flexible, tube-like structure that connects the fetus to the placenta. It contains two umbilical arteries (carrying deoxygenated blood and waste from fetus to placenta) and one umbilical vein (carrying oxygenated blood and nutrients from placenta to fetus). It is the lifeline between the mother and the developing baby.
19. Gastrulation is a critical process during early embryonic development where the inner cell mass differentiates and reorganizes to form the three primary germ layers: ectoderm (outer), mesoderm (middle), and endoderm (inner). These germ layers are fundamental as all tissues and organs of the adult body develop from them.
20. During the first trimester (weeks 1-12), major organ systems begin to form (organogenesis). The heart starts beating, limbs develop, and the brain and spinal cord form. The embryo transforms into a fetus by the end of this trimester, though it is still very small.
21. The second trimester (weeks 13-27) is characterized by rapid growth and maturation of organs. The fetus becomes more active, and the mother can feel its movements (quickening). Hair, eyelashes, and eyebrows appear. The sex of the baby can often be determined by ultrasound.
22. The third trimester (weeks 28-40) is primarily a period of rapid weight gain and final maturation of organs, especially the lungs. The fetus prepares for birth, turning into a head-down position. The mother experiences increased discomfort and prepares for labor.
23. Parturition is initiated by complex neuroendocrine mechanisms. Signals from the fully developed fetus and the placenta induce mild uterine contractions (fetal ejection reflex). This triggers the release of oxytocin from the maternal pituitary, which causes stronger uterine contractions, leading to labor.
24. Lactation is the production and secretion of milk by mammary glands. It is primarily regulated by prolactin, which stimulates milk synthesis, and oxytocin, which causes milk ejection (let-down reflex) in response to suckling. Breast milk provides complete nutrition and antibodies to the infant.
25. Colostrum is the first milk produced by the mother, rich in antibodies (IgA), proteins, and vitamins. It provides passive immunity to the newborn, protecting them from infections, and also helps in the development of the infant's digestive system.
26. Spermatogenesis is the continuous process of sperm formation in males, producing millions of sperms. Oogenesis is the discontinuous process of ovum formation in females, producing only one ovum per cycle. Spermatogenesis produces four functional gametes from one primary spermatocyte, while oogenesis produces one functional ovum and polar bodies from one primary oocyte.
27. The male reproductive system is designed for continuous sperm production and delivery, with external testes for temperature regulation. The female system is designed for cyclical egg production, fertilization, and nurturing a developing embryo/fetus internally. Both systems are hormonally regulated, but the patterns and specific hormones differ significantly.
28. Seminiferous tubules are highly coiled structures located within the testes. They are the sites of spermatogenesis, where sperm are produced. They are lined by spermatogonia and Sertoli cells.
29. The epididymis is a long, coiled tube located on the posterior side of each testis. It serves as the site for sperm maturation, where sperms acquire motility and fertilizing capacity. It also stores sperms before ejaculation.
30. The fallopian tubes (oviducts) are paired tubes extending from the uterus to near the ovaries. They consist of the infundibulum (funnel-shaped with fimbriae), ampulla (site of fertilization), and isthmus (narrow part joining uterus). They transport the ovum from the ovary to the uterus.
31. The uterus is a hollow, muscular, pear-shaped organ located in the pelvic cavity. Its primary function is to receive the fertilized egg, provide a site for implantation, and support the development of the embryo and fetus throughout pregnancy. Its muscular walls contract during parturition.
32. The ovary is the primary female sex organ, located in the pelvic cavity. It produces female gametes (ova) through oogenesis and secretes female sex hormones, estrogen and progesterone, which regulate the menstrual cycle and secondary sexual characteristics.
33. The hypothalamus secretes GnRH, which stimulates the anterior pituitary. The anterior pituitary then secretes FSH and LH. These gonadotropins act on the gonads (testes/ovaries) to stimulate gamete production and hormone secretion, forming a crucial part of the neuroendocrine regulation of reproduction.
34. In males, GnRH stimulates LH and FSH release. LH stimulates Leydig cells to produce testosterone. FSH and testosterone stimulate spermatogenesis. Testosterone and inhibin (from Sertoli cells) provide negative feedback to the hypothalamus and pituitary, regulating hormone levels.
35. In females, GnRH stimulates FSH and LH release. FSH stimulates follicular growth and estrogen secretion. LH triggers ovulation and corpus luteum formation, which secretes progesterone. Estrogen and progesterone provide negative feedback, but estrogen can also exert positive feedback leading to the LH surge.
36. The primary oocyte, arrested in Prophase I since fetal life, resumes meiosis I just before ovulation. It completes meiosis I, resulting in a large secondary oocyte and a small first polar body. The secondary oocyte then proceeds to Metaphase II and is released during ovulation.
37. If fertilization occurs, the corpus luteum persists due to hCG secreted by the trophoblast. It continues to secrete progesterone, maintaining the pregnancy. If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates after about 14 days, leading to a drop in progesterone and the onset of menstruation.
38. During the secretory (luteal) phase, under the influence of progesterone from the corpus luteum, the endometrium becomes highly vascularized, glandular, and thick. The endometrial glands secrete uterine milk, making the uterus receptive for implantation of the blastocyst.
39. Capacitation is a series of physiological changes that sperms undergo in the female reproductive tract (uterus and fallopian tubes) before they can fertilize an egg. These changes involve alterations in the sperm membrane that enable them to undergo the acrosome reaction and become hyperactive.
40. The block to polyspermy is a mechanism that prevents multiple sperms from fertilizing a single egg. It involves two main events: a fast block (depolarization of the egg membrane) and a slow block (cortical reaction), where enzymes released from cortical granules modify the zona pellucula, preventing any further sperm from entering (block to polyspermy).
41. Blastulation is the process of forming a blastocyst from a morula. As the morula enters the uterus, fluid seeps into it, creating a central cavity called the blastocoel. The cells rearrange to form an outer trophoblast layer and an inner cell mass, thus forming the blastocyst.
42. The inner cell mass (embryoblast) of the blastocyst differentiates into the epiblast and hypoblast, forming a bilaminar embryonic disc. The epiblast gives rise to the three primary germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm) during gastrulation, which will form all the tissues and organs of the embryo.
43. The amniotic cavity forms within the epiblast, filling with amniotic fluid that cushions and protects the embryo. The yolk sac forms from the hypoblast and is involved in early blood cell formation and nutrient transfer before the placenta is fully functional.
44. The chorion is the outermost extraembryonic membrane, formed from the trophoblast and extraembryonic mesoderm. It develops chorionic villi that contribute to the placenta. The amnion is the inner membrane that encloses the amniotic cavity, providing a protective environment for the embryo.
45. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a glycoprotein hormone secreted by the trophoblast cells of the blastocyst after implantation. Its primary role is to maintain the corpus luteum, preventing its degeneration and ensuring the continued secretion of progesterone, which is essential for maintaining the uterine lining and preventing menstruation.
46. During pregnancy, the mother's body undergoes significant physiological changes. These include increased blood volume, cardiac output, and respiratory rate. The kidneys work harder, and the digestive system may experience nausea and constipation. Hormonal changes lead to breast enlargement and uterine growth.
47. Labor is divided into three stages. Stage 1 (dilation) involves regular uterine contractions that cause the cervix to efface (thin) and dilate (open). Stage 2 (expulsion) begins when the cervix is fully dilated and ends with the delivery of the baby. Stage 3 (placental) involves the delivery of the placenta after the baby is born.
48. Breastfeeding provides optimal nutrition for the baby, containing all necessary nutrients and antibodies for immunity. For the mother, it helps the uterus contract, reduces postpartum bleeding, and lowers the risk of certain cancers. It also promotes bonding between mother and baby.
49. Causes of male infertility can include low sperm count (oligospermia), poor sperm motility (asthenozoospermia), abnormal sperm morphology (teratozoospermia), blockages in the reproductive tract, hormonal imbalances, genetic factors, and lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking, excessive heat).
50. Causes of female infertility can include ovulatory disorders (e.g., PCOS), blocked fallopian tubes (due to PID or endometriosis), uterine abnormalities (e.g., fibroids), endometriosis, hormonal imbalances, and age-related decline in egg quality and quantity.
51. In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is an Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) where eggs are retrieved from the woman's ovaries and fertilized by sperm in a laboratory dish (in vitro). The resulting embryos are then cultured for a few days before being transferred into the woman's uterus.
52. Zygote Intrafallopian Transfer (ZIFT) is an ART where eggs are fertilized in vitro, and the resulting zygotes (fertilized eggs) are immediately transferred into the fallopian tube, allowing natural transport to the uterus for implantation.
53. Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer (GIFT) is an ART where eggs and sperm are collected and then directly transferred into the fallopian tube, allowing fertilization to occur naturally inside the woman's body. It requires at least one healthy fallopian tube.
54. Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) is a specialized IVF procedure where a single sperm is directly injected into an egg. It is particularly useful in cases of severe male infertility (e.g., very low sperm count or poor motility) or when previous IVF attempts have failed.
55. Ethical considerations in ART include the moral status of embryos, selective reduction (reducing the number of fetuses in multiple pregnancies), genetic screening of embryos, surrogacy, and the potential for designer babies. These raise complex questions about life, parenthood, and societal values.
56. Prostaglandins are lipid compounds that act like hormones. In reproduction, they are involved in various processes: they stimulate uterine contractions during menstruation and parturition, play a role in sperm motility, and are involved in ovulation and corpus luteum regression.
57. The blood-testis barrier is a physiological barrier formed by tight junctions between Sertoli cells, which protects developing sperm from the immune system and harmful substances in the blood.
58. Spermiation is the process by which mature spermatozoa are released from the Sertoli cells into the lumen of the seminiferous tubules. This is the final step of spermatogenesis before sperms are transported to the epididymis for maturation.
59. Inhibin is a hormone secreted by Sertoli cells in males (and granulosa cells in females). In males, it selectively inhibits the secretion of FSH from the anterior pituitary, providing a negative feedback mechanism to regulate spermatogenesis.
60. A mature ovarian follicle (Graafian follicle) is a large, fluid-filled structure containing a secondary oocyte. It consists of several layers of granulosa cells, a fluid-filled antrum, and two layers of theca cells (theca interna and theca externa).
61. If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates after about 14 days. It transforms into a small, white scar tissue called the corpus albicans, which marks the end of the luteal phase and leads to menstruation.
62. Menopause is characterized by a decline in ovarian function, leading to a decrease in estrogen and progesterone production. This results in elevated FSH and LH levels (due to lack of negative feedback) and the cessation of menstrual cycles.
63. Estrogen is the primary female sex hormone. It is responsible for the development of female secondary sexual characteristics (e.g., breast development, widening of hips), stimulates the growth and proliferation of the endometrium, and plays a role in bone density and cardiovascular health.
64. Progesterone is a steroid hormone primarily secreted by the corpus luteum. Its main role is to prepare and maintain the uterine lining (endometrium) for implantation and pregnancy. It also inhibits uterine contractions and suppresses the immune response to the fetus.
65. Relaxin is a hormone produced by the corpus luteum and placenta during pregnancy. It helps to relax the ligaments in the pelvis and soften the cervix, making it easier for the baby to pass through the birth canal during parturition.
66. Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent cells derived from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst. They have the ability to differentiate into any cell type of the body. Their differentiation is guided by specific growth factors and signaling molecules in their environment.
67. Totipotency is the ability of a single cell (like a zygote) to differentiate into all cell types, including extraembryonic tissues. Pluripotency is the ability of a cell (like an embryonic stem cell) to differentiate into all cell types of the three germ layers, but not extraembryonic tissues.
68. The neural tube develops from the ectoderm during neurulation. It forms the brain and spinal cord. Defects in neural tube closure can lead to conditions like spina bifida.
69. Somites are segmented blocks of mesoderm that form along the neural tube. They differentiate into various structures, including vertebrae, ribs, skeletal muscles of the trunk and limbs, and dermis of the skin.
70. The heart begins to develop from mesoderm cells around the third week of gestation. It starts as a simple tube that folds and septates to form the four-chambered heart, becoming functional and beginning to beat by the fourth week.
71. Limb buds appear around the fourth week of gestation. They develop from the lateral plate mesoderm and are patterned by signaling molecules like FGF and Sonic Hedgehog, leading to the formation of bones, muscles, and connective tissues of the upper and lower limbs.
72. The face develops from five facial prominences that fuse during the 4th to 10th weeks of gestation. Failure of these prominences to fuse properly can result in congenital anomalies like cleft lip and palate.
73. The brain develops from the anterior part of the neural tube. It undergoes rapid growth and differentiation, forming the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain, which further develop into the cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, and other structures.
74. The eyes develop from outgrowths of the forebrain (optic vesicles) and ectoderm. The ears develop from ectodermal thickenings (otic placodes) that invaginate to form the inner ear, while the middle and outer ear develop from pharyngeal arches.
75. The digestive system develops from the endoderm, forming the primitive gut tube. Outgrowths from this tube give rise to organs like the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder. The mesoderm forms the muscular and connective tissue layers of the gut wall.
76. The respiratory system develops as an outgrowth from the foregut endoderm. The trachea, bronchi, and lungs form from this outgrowth, undergoing extensive branching and differentiation to form the complex alveolar structure necessary for gas exchange.
77. The urinary system develops from the intermediate mesoderm. The kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra form sequentially, with the kidneys becoming functional and producing urine by the end of the first trimester.
78. The reproductive organs develop from the intermediate mesoderm and primordial germ cells. Initially, both male and female embryos have indifferent gonads. The presence or absence of the SRY gene on the Y chromosome determines whether the gonad develops into a testis or an ovary.
79. Sex determination in humans is chromosomal. Individuals with XX chromosomes are typically female, and those with XY chromosomes are typically male. The presence of the SRY gene on the Y chromosome is the key factor that triggers male development.
80. The SRY (Sex-determining Region Y) gene is located on the Y chromosome. Its presence initiates the development of the indifferent gonad into a testis. In the absence of SRY, the gonad develops into an ovary.
81. Fraternal (dizygotic) twins result from the fertilization of two separate eggs by two separate sperms. They are genetically as similar as any other siblings. Identical (monozygotic) twins result from the splitting of a single fertilized egg (zygote) into two embryos. They are genetically identical.
82. Conjoined twins occur when a single fertilized egg fails to completely separate into two distinct embryos during early development. The extent of fusion varies, leading to different types of conjoined twins depending on which body parts are shared.
83. Ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, most commonly in the fallopian tube. It can also occur in the ovary, abdomen, or cervix. It is a medical emergency as the pregnancy cannot survive and can cause severe internal bleeding.
84. Preeclampsia is a serious pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to another organ system, most often the liver and kidneys. Symptoms include severe headaches, vision changes, and swelling. It can lead to eclampsia, which involves seizures.
85. Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy in women who did not have diabetes before. It is caused by insulin resistance due to pregnancy hormones. Symptoms are often mild, but it can lead to complications for both mother and baby if not managed.
86. Prenatal care is essential for a healthy pregnancy outcome. It involves regular medical check-ups, monitoring maternal and fetal health, nutritional counseling, screening for potential complications, and preparing for childbirth. It helps detect and manage issues early.
87. Birth control methods include hormonal methods (pills, patches, injections, implants), barrier methods (condoms, diaphragms), intrauterine devices (IUDs), natural family planning, and permanent methods (vasectomy, tubal ligation).
88. Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) primarily work by releasing synthetic estrogen and progesterone, which inhibit the release of FSH and LH from the pituitary. This prevents ovulation and also thickens cervical mucus (blocking sperm) and thins the uterine lining (preventing implantation).
89. Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are small, T-shaped devices inserted into the uterus. Hormonal IUDs release progestin, which thickens cervical mucus and thins the uterine lining. Copper IUDs cause an inflammatory reaction in the uterus that is toxic to sperm and eggs, preventing fertilization and implantation.
90. Vasectomy is a permanent male birth control method. It involves surgically cutting or sealing the vas deferens, which are the tubes that carry sperm from the testes. This prevents sperm from mixing with semen during ejaculation, making the man sterile.
91. Tubal ligation is a permanent female birth control method. It involves surgically cutting, tying, or sealing the fallopian tubes. This prevents eggs from traveling from the ovaries to the uterus and blocks sperm from reaching the egg, thus preventing fertilization.
92. Common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) include Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Syphilis, Herpes, HPV (Human Papillomavirus), and HIV/AIDS. They are spread primarily through sexual contact.
93. Methods of preventing STIs include abstinence, consistent and correct use of condoms, limiting the number of sexual partners, getting tested regularly, and vaccination (e.g., for HPV).
94. Chlamydia is a common bacterial STI. Symptoms are often mild or absent, but can include abnormal discharge, painful urination, and pelvic pain. Untreated Chlamydia can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women, causing infertility and ectopic pregnancy.
95. Gonorrhea is a bacterial STI. Symptoms can include painful urination, abnormal discharge, and pelvic pain. Like Chlamydia, untreated Gonorrhea can lead to PID, infertility, and can also affect joints, heart, and other body parts.
96. Syphilis is a bacterial STI that progresses through stages. Primary syphilis involves a painless sore (chancre). Secondary syphilis involves a rash and flu-like symptoms. Tertiary syphilis can cause severe damage to the heart, brain, and other organs. It is curable with antibiotics.
97. Herpes is a viral STI caused by HSV. It causes painful blisters and sores, primarily on the genitals or mouth. It is a lifelong infection, with recurrent outbreaks. There is no cure, but antiviral medications can manage symptoms and reduce outbreaks.
98. HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a viral infection that attacks the immune system. AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) is the late stage of HIV infection. HIV is transmitted through specific body fluids. There is no cure, but antiretroviral therapy can manage the virus and prevent progression to AIDS.
99. Sexual health education is crucial for empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their sexual health. It provides knowledge about anatomy, reproduction, contraception, STIs, consent, and healthy relationships, promoting responsible sexual behavior and well-being.
100. Ethical considerations in human reproduction include issues like access to ART, genetic selection, surrogacy, embryo research, and the rights of gamete donors and offspring. These topics often involve balancing individual autonomy with societal values and moral principles.
