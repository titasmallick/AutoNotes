### SECTION C: SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS (2 MARKS) Answer Key:

1.  **Explain the importance of reproductive health.**
    *   **Answer:** Reproductive health is crucial for responsible parenthood, enabling informed decisions about family size. It also helps in preventing STDs, improving maternal and child health by reducing mortality rates, and managing population growth.
2.  **List the key objectives of RCH programs.**
    *   **Answer:** Key objectives include creating awareness about reproductive health, providing support for safe sexual practices, offering birth control facilities, managing and preventing STDs, and providing care for pregnant mothers and children.
3.  **Define population explosion and its causes.**
    *   **Answer:** Population explosion is the rapid increase in human population, particularly after the mid-20th century. It is primarily caused by a sharp decline in death rates (due to improved healthcare and sanitation) and a relatively high birth rate.
4.  **Explain two motivational measures for population control.**
    *   **Answer:** Two motivational measures are promoting small family norms, such as the "Hum Do Hamare Do" slogan, and providing incentives to couples with smaller families. Additionally, raising the legal marriageable age for females (18) and males (21) also serves as a motivational measure.
5.  **List the characteristics of an ideal contraceptive.**
    *   **Answer:** An ideal contraceptive should be user-friendly, easily available, effective, and reversible. It should have no or minimal side effects and should not interfere with sexual drive.
6.  **Explain the rhythm method of contraception.**
    *   **Answer:** The rhythm method, or periodic abstinence, involves avoiding coitus during the fertile period of the menstrual cycle, typically from day 10 to 17, when ovulation is expected. This method has high chances of failure.
7.  **Describe coitus interruptus method.**
    *   **Answer:** Coitus interruptus, or the withdrawal method, involves the male withdrawing the penis from the vagina just before ejaculation to prevent insemination. This method also has high chances of failure.
8.  **Explain lactational amenorrhea.**
    *   **Answer:** Lactational amenorrhea is a natural method of contraception based on the absence of menstruation during intense lactation following parturition. High prolactin levels during this period suppress ovulation, preventing conception for up to six months if breastfeeding is full and exclusive.
9.  **Describe the use of condoms.**
    *   **Answer:** Condoms are thin rubber/latex sheaths used to cover the penis (male condom) or line the vagina/cervix (female condom). They prevent the deposition of semen in the vagina and also offer protection against STDs.
10. **Explain the mechanism of copper-releasing IUDs.**
    *   **Answer:** Copper-releasing IUDs (e.g., CuT, Cu7) release copper ions into the uterus. These copper ions suppress the motility of sperm and their fertilizing capacity, thereby preventing conception.
11. **Describe the working of hormone-releasing IUDs.**
    *   **Answer:** Hormone-releasing IUDs (e.g., Progestasert, LNG-20) make the uterus unsuitable for implantation of the embryo. They also alter the quality of the cervical mucus, making it hostile to sperm, thus preventing their entry.
12. **Explain the mechanism of combined oral contraceptive pills.**
    *   **Answer:** Combined oral contraceptive pills contain a combination of progestogen and estrogen. Their primary mechanism is to inhibit ovulation, preventing the release of an egg. They also alter the uterine lining to make it unsuitable for implantation and change cervical mucus to impede sperm entry.
13. **Describe Saheli contraceptive.**
    *   **Answer:** Saheli is a new oral contraceptive for females developed by CDRI, Lucknow. It is a non-steroidal preparation, taken once a week, and is known for having very few side effects, making it a convenient option.
14. **Explain vasectomy procedure.**
    *   **Answer:** Vasectomy is a surgical sterilization method for males. In this procedure, a small part of the vas deferens (the tube that carries sperm from the testes) is cut or tied up. This prevents sperm from reaching the urethra, making the male infertile.
15. **Describe tubectomy procedure.**
    *   **Answer:** Tubectomy is a surgical sterilization method for females. It involves cutting or tying up a small part of the fallopian tube. This prevents the ovum from reaching the uterus and also prevents sperm from reaching the ovum, thus preventing fertilization.
16. **List three reasons for MTP.**
    *   **Answer:** Three reasons for Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) include unwanted pregnancies resulting from unprotected intercourse, failure of contraceptives, or rape. MTP is also performed if the continuation of pregnancy poses a risk to the mother's life or if the fetus is diagnosed with severe abnormalities.
17. **Explain why first trimester is safer for MTP.**
    *   **Answer:** MTPs are relatively safer during the first trimester (up to 12 weeks of pregnancy) because the fetus is less developed, and the procedure is less complex. Second-trimester abortions are riskier due to the increased size and development of the fetus and associated complications.
18. **List four bacterial STDs.**
    *   **Answer:** Four common bacterial STDs are Syphilis (caused by *Treponema pallidum*), Gonorrhoea (caused by *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*), Chlamydiasis (caused by *Chlamydia trachomatis*), and Chancroid.
19. **List four viral STDs.**
    *   **Answer:** Four common viral STDs include Genital Herpes (Herpes Simplex Virus - HSV), Genital Warts (Human Papillomavirus - HPV), Hepatitis B (Hepatitis B Virus - HBV), and AIDS (HIV).
20. **Explain early symptoms of STDs.**
    *   **Answer:** Early symptoms of STDs are often minor and may include itching, fluid discharge, slight pain, and swellings in the genital region. However, many infected individuals, especially females, may be asymptomatic, leading to delayed detection.
21. **List four complications of untreated STDs.**
    *   **Answer:** If left untreated, STDs can lead to severe complications such as Pelvic Inflammatory Diseases (PID), abortions, stillbirths, ectopic pregnancies, infertility, and even cancer of the reproductive tract.
22. **Explain two prevention methods for STDs.**
    *   **Answer:** Two effective prevention methods for STDs are avoiding sex with unknown or multiple partners (practicing monogamy) and consistently using condoms during coitus. Additionally, avoiding sharing needles, razors, and toothbrushes can prevent transmission.
23. **Describe the procedure of amniocentesis.**
    *   **Answer:** Amniocentesis involves withdrawing a small amount of amniotic fluid from the uterus of a pregnant woman. Fetal cells present in this fluid are then cultured, and their chromosomal patterns are analyzed to detect chromosomal abnormalities or genetic disorders.
24. **List three chromosomal abnormalities detected by amniocentesis.**
    *   **Answer:** Three chromosomal abnormalities that can be detected by amniocentesis are Down's syndrome, Klinefelter's syndrome, and Turner's syndrome.
25. **List three genetic disorders detected by amniocentesis.**
    *   **Answer:** Three genetic disorders that can be detected by amniocentesis are haemophilia, sickle-cell anemia, and cystic fibrosis.
26. **Define infertility and its duration.**
    *   **Answer:** Infertility is defined as the inability to conceive or produce children even after 1-2 years of unprotected sexual cohabitation. The causes can be attributed to male partners, female partners, or both.
27. **Explain the principle of IVF.**
    *   **Answer:** The principle of In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) involves fertilizing the ovum with sperm outside the body, in a controlled laboratory setting. The resulting zygote or early embryo is then transferred into the female's reproductive tract.
28. **Describe ZIFT procedure.**
    *   **Answer:** Zygote Intrafallopian Transfer (ZIFT) is an ART procedure where the zygote or an early embryo (up to 8 blastomeres) formed through in vitro fertilization is transferred directly into the fallopian tube of the female.
29. **Explain GIFT technique.**
    *   **Answer:** Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer (GIFT) is a technique where an ovum collected from a donor is transferred into the fallopian tube of another female who cannot produce ova but can provide a suitable environment for fertilization and development. Sperm are also transferred into the fallopian tube.
30. **Describe ICSI procedure.**
    *   **Answer:** Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) is a specialized ART procedure where a single sperm is directly injected into the cytoplasm of an ovum in the laboratory. This technique is particularly useful for males with very low sperm counts or issues with sperm motility.
31. **Explain artificial insemination.**
    *   **Answer:** Artificial Insemination (AI) involves artificially introducing semen, collected from the husband or a healthy donor, into the vagina or uterus of the female. This method is used when the male partner has a very low sperm count or is unable to inseminate the female.
32. **List two advantages of reproductive health programs.**
    *   **Answer:** Two advantages of reproductive health programs are creating widespread awareness about reproductive health issues and providing essential facilities and support for family planning and safe sexual practices, leading to a reproductively healthy society.
33. **Explain two consequences of population explosion.**
    *   **Answer:** Two major consequences of population explosion are scarcity of resources like food, water, and housing, leading to increased poverty and unemployment. It also contributes to environmental degradation due to increased consumption and waste.
34. **Describe two types of barrier methods.**
    *   **Answer:** Two types of barrier methods are condoms (thin rubber/latex sheaths covering the penis or lining the vagina) and diaphragms (reusable rubber barriers inserted into the vagina to cover the cervix). Both physically prevent sperm from meeting the ovum.
35. **Compare medicated and non-medicated IUDs.**
    *   **Answer:** Non-medicated IUDs (e.g., Lippes Loop) primarily increase the phagocytosis of sperm within the uterus. Medicated IUDs, such as copper-releasing IUDs (e.g., CuT) or hormone-releasing IUDs (e.g., Progestasert), release substances that enhance their contraceptive effect by suppressing sperm or making the uterus unsuitable for implantation.
36. **Differentiate between combined pills and mini-pills.**
    *   **Answer:** Combined pills contain both progestogen and estrogen, inhibiting ovulation and implantation. Mini-pills contain only progestogen and primarily work by altering cervical mucus and uterine lining, with a lesser effect on ovulation.
37. **Compare reversible and irreversible contraceptive methods.**
    *   **Answer:** Reversible methods, like pills, IUDs, or condoms, allow for the return of fertility after discontinuation. Irreversible methods, such as surgical sterilization (vasectomy and tubectomy), are permanent and are chosen when no more children are desired.
38. **Explain the misuse of MTP.**

### SECTION D: LONG ANSWER QUESTIONS (3 MARKS) Answer Key:

1.  **Explain the concept of reproductive health and its importance in building a healthy society.**
    *   **Answer:** Reproductive health is a holistic state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being in all matters related to the reproductive system, not merely the absence of disease. It is vital for a healthy society as it enables individuals to have a responsible, satisfying, and safe sex life, and the freedom to decide if, when, and how often to reproduce. This promotes informed family planning, reduces the burden of STDs, and improves overall maternal and child health, contributing to a healthier and more stable population.
2.  **Describe the RCH programs in India, their objectives, and their impact on society.**
    *   **Answer:** The Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) programs, initiated in India in 1951 as Family Planning Programs, aim to create awareness about reproductive health and provide facilities for a reproductively healthy society. Their key objectives include promoting safe sexual practices, offering birth control, managing STDs, and providing care for mothers and children. These programs have significantly impacted society by reducing maternal and infant mortality, controlling population growth, and increasing public awareness about reproductive well-being.
3.  **Discuss population explosion, its causes, consequences, and various control measures.**
    *   **Answer:** Population explosion refers to the rapid and alarming increase in human population, particularly since the mid-20th century. Its primary causes are a sharp decline in death rates due to improved healthcare and sanitation, coupled with a relatively high birth rate. Consequences include scarcity of resources, increased poverty, unemployment, and environmental degradation. Control measures involve motivational strategies like promoting small family norms and raising marriageable age, alongside the widespread adoption of various contraceptive methods.
4.  **Explain the motivational measures for population control and their effectiveness.**
    *   **Answer:** Motivational measures for population control aim to encourage smaller family sizes through societal and legal changes. These include promoting slogans like "Hum Do Hamare Do," providing incentives to couples with fewer children, and legally raising the marriageable age for females to 18 and males to 21. Education, especially for women, about the benefits of small families and family planning is also crucial. While these measures contribute to awareness and behavioral change, their effectiveness varies depending on cultural and socioeconomic factors.
5.  **Describe the different types of natural contraceptive methods with their advantages and disadvantages.**
    *   **Answer:** Natural contraceptive methods are barrier-free and involve no medicines or devices. They include Periodic Abstinence (Rhythm Method), where coitus is avoided during the fertile period, and Coitus Interruptus (Withdrawal Method), where the male withdraws before ejaculation. Lactational Amenorrhea, the absence of menstruation during intense breastfeeding, also prevents conception for up to six months. Advantages include no side effects and being cost-free. However, their major disadvantage is a high chance of failure due to human error and difficulty in precise prediction of fertile periods.
6.  **Explain the various artificial contraceptive methods and their mechanisms of action.**
    *   **Answer:** Artificial contraceptive methods involve external interventions to prevent pregnancy. Barrier methods (condoms, diaphragms) physically block sperm. IUDs (Lippes Loop, CuT, Progestasert) work by increasing phagocytosis of sperm, suppressing sperm motility, or making the uterus unsuitable for implantation. Oral contraceptives (pills) inhibit ovulation and implantation. Implants release hormones for long-term prevention. Surgical methods (vasectomy, tubectomy) permanently block gamete transport. Each method has a distinct mechanism to prevent fertilization or implantation.
7.  **Discuss barrier methods of contraception, their types, and effectiveness.**
    *   **Answer:** Barrier methods prevent the physical meeting of sperm and ovum. Types include male condoms (sheaths covering the penis), female condoms (lining the vagina), diaphragms, cervical caps, and vaults (reusable rubber barriers covering the cervix). Condoms also offer protection against STDs. Their effectiveness depends heavily on correct and consistent use. While generally effective when used properly, user error can lead to higher failure rates compared to hormonal methods or IUDs.
8.  **Describe intrauterine devices (IUDs), their types, mechanisms, and advantages.**
    *   **Answer:** Intrauterine Devices (IUDs) are small devices inserted into the uterus by a doctor. Types include non-medicated IUDs (e.g., Lippes Loop), which increase phagocytosis of sperm; copper-releasing IUDs (e.g., CuT, Cu7), which suppress sperm motility and fertilizing capacity; and hormone-releasing IUDs (e.g., Progestasert, LNG-20), which make the uterus unsuitable for implantation and the cervix hostile to sperm. Advantages include long-term effectiveness, reversibility, and not requiring daily attention.
9.  **Explain hormonal contraceptives, their types, mechanisms, and side effects.**
    *   **Answer:** Hormonal contraceptives primarily work by inhibiting ovulation, altering the uterine lining to prevent implantation, and thickening cervical mucus to block sperm entry. Types include oral contraceptive pills (combined pills with estrogen and progestogen, or mini-pills with only progestogen), implants, and injectables. Common side effects can include nausea, weight gain, mood changes, and irregular bleeding. While generally safe, more serious but rare side effects like blood clots can occur, requiring medical consultation.
10. **Discuss surgical methods of contraception, their procedures, and considerations.**
    *   **Answer:** Surgical methods, or sterilization, are terminal and highly effective contraceptive options. Vasectomy for males involves cutting or tying a small part of the vas deferens, preventing sperm release. Tubectomy for females involves cutting or tying a small part of the fallopian tube, preventing ovum transport. These procedures are generally simple but irreversible, making careful consideration and counseling essential. They are chosen by individuals or couples who have completed their family and desire permanent birth control.
11. **Explain Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP), its legal aspects, and safety considerations.**
    *   **Answer:** Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP), or induced abortion, is the intentional termination of pregnancy before full term. In India, it was legalized in 1971 under strict conditions to prevent misuse, such as illegal female foeticide. MTPs are relatively safe when performed during the first trimester (up to 12 weeks) by qualified medical professionals. However, second-trimester abortions carry higher risks. The legal framework aims to balance a woman's reproductive rights with preventing unethical practices.
12. **Describe sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), their types, and transmission modes.**
    *   **Answer:** Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs), also known as Venereal Diseases (VD) or Reproductive Tract Infections (RTI), are infections primarily transmitted through sexual contact (vaginal, anal, oral). Types include bacterial STDs (e.g., Syphilis, Gonorrhoea, Chlamydiasis), viral STDs (e.g., Genital Herpes, Hepatitis B, AIDS), and protozoal STDs (e.g., Trichomoniasis). Some, like Hepatitis B and HIV, can also spread through contaminated blood, shared needles, or from mother to child.
13. **Discuss the prevention and treatment strategies for STDs.**
    *   **Answer:** Prevention of STDs involves practicing safe sex, such as consistent and correct use of condoms, and avoiding sex with unknown or multiple partners (practicing monogamy). Avoiding sharing needles, razors, and toothbrushes also helps. For treatment, early detection is crucial, as many STDs can be asymptomatic, especially in females. Bacterial STDs are curable with antibiotics, while viral STDs are generally incurable but their symptoms can be managed. Complete treatment by a qualified doctor is essential to prevent complications and further transmission.
14. **Explain amniocentesis, its procedure, applications, and ethical considerations.**
    *   **Answer:** Amniocentesis is a prenatal diagnostic technique involving the withdrawal of a small amount of amniotic fluid from the uterus. Fetal cells in the fluid are cultured and their chromosomes analyzed. Its primary applications are detecting chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., Down's syndrome) and genetic disorders (e.g., haemophilia). Ethically, while valuable for diagnosis, it faces concerns due to its misuse for illegal sex determination leading to female foeticide, which is banned in India. This highlights the tension between medical utility and potential societal harm.
15. **Describe infertility, its causes, and the various assisted reproductive technologies.**
    *   **Answer:** Infertility is the inability to conceive or produce children after 1-2 years of unprotected sexual cohabitation. Causes can be diverse, affecting males (e.g., low sperm count, inability to inseminate) or females (e.g., blocked fallopian tubes, inability to produce ova), or both. Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) are techniques to help infertile couples. These include In Vitro Fertilization (IVF), Zygote Intrafallopian Transfer (ZIFT), Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer (GIFT), Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI), and Artificial Insemination (AI), each addressing specific infertility issues.
16. **Explain In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and its applications in treating infertility.**
    *   **Answer:** In Vitro Fertilization (IVF), commonly known as the "test-tube baby" program, involves fertilizing an ovum with sperm outside the body in a laboratory setting. After fertilization, the resulting zygote or early embryo (up to 8 blastomeres) is transferred into the female's fallopian tube (ZIFT) or uterus (IUT). IVF is widely applied for infertility cases where females have blocked fallopian tubes, or males have low sperm counts or other issues preventing natural fertilization, offering a significant chance for conception.
17. **Discuss the different types of embryo transfer techniques and their applications.**
    *   **Answer:** Embryo transfer (ET) techniques are crucial steps in Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) after in vitro fertilization. Zygote Intrafallopian Transfer (ZIFT) involves transferring the zygote or early embryo (up to 8 blastomeres) into the fallopian tube. Intra Uterine Transfer (IUT) involves transferring an embryo with more than 8 blastomeres directly into the uterus. Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer (GIFT) involves transferring ovum and sperm into the fallopian tube for fertilization *in vivo*. These techniques are chosen based on the stage of embryo development and the specific infertility issue.
18. **Describe artificial insemination and its role in treating male infertility.**
    *   **Answer:** Artificial Insemination (AI) is an ART procedure primarily used to treat male infertility. It involves artificially introducing semen, collected from the husband or a healthy donor, into the female's vagina or uterus. Intra Uterine Insemination (IUI), a common form of AI, directly injects semen into the uterus. AI is particularly beneficial for males with very low sperm counts, poor sperm motility, or those unable to inseminate the female partner naturally, thereby facilitating conception.
19. **Explain the role of education and awareness in promoting reproductive health.**
    *   **Answer:** Education and awareness are foundational to promoting reproductive health. Comprehensive education provides individuals with accurate information about reproductive organs, adolescence, safe and hygienic sexual practices, contraception, and STDs.

21. **Describe the impact of reproductive health programs on maternal and child mortality.**
    *   **Answer:** Reproductive health programs have a profound impact on reducing maternal and child mortality rates. By promoting family planning, they enable women to space pregnancies, reducing risks associated with frequent childbirth. They also ensure access to quality antenatal, delivery, and postnatal care, manage complications, and prevent infections like STDs that can affect both mother and child. This comprehensive approach leads to healthier pregnancies, safer deliveries, and improved survival rates for infants and young children.
22. **Explain the importance of contraceptive counseling and informed choice.**
    *   **Answer:** Contraceptive counseling is vital as it provides individuals with comprehensive information about all available birth control methods, including their effectiveness, side effects, benefits, and risks. This enables informed choice, where individuals can select a method that best suits their health, lifestyle, and reproductive goals without coercion. Informed choice respects individual autonomy and leads to higher satisfaction and continuation rates with the chosen contraceptive method, contributing to effective family planning.
23. **Discuss the ethical and legal issues surrounding reproductive health services.**
    *   **Answer:** Reproductive health services are fraught with ethical and legal complexities. Ethical concerns include the high cost and accessibility of ART, the moral status of embryos, and issues surrounding surrogacy and donor anonymity. Legally, countries regulate practices like MTP (to prevent misuse) and ban sex determination tests (to combat female foeticide). Balancing individual reproductive rights with societal values and preventing exploitation remains a continuous challenge, necessitating careful policy development and oversight.
24. **Describe the role of healthcare providers in reproductive health promotion.**
    *   **Answer:** Healthcare providers play a pivotal role in reproductive health promotion. They offer accurate information, counseling, and services related to contraception, STD prevention, and family planning. They perform procedures like IUD insertion and MTP safely, diagnose and treat STDs, and manage infertility.
