### Part C: Medium Answer Questions
1.  **Heredity vs. Variation:** Heredity is the transmission of traits from one generation to the next, ensuring similarity. Variation refers to the differences among individuals of a species, which can be caused by genetic recombination, mutation, or environmental factors, and is the basis for evolution.
2.  **Mendel's choice of pea plant:** Mendel chose pea plants because they have a short life cycle, produce many offspring, have easily distinguishable contrasting traits (e.g., tall/dwarf, round/wrinkled), and their pollination could be easily controlled.
3.  **Law of Dominance:** This law states that in a heterozygous individual, one allele (the dominant one) will mask the effect of the other allele (the recessive one). For example, in a pea plant with alleles for tallness (T) and dwarfness (t), the Tt genotype will result in a tall plant because the tall allele is dominant.
4.  **Law of Segregation:** This law states that the two alleles for each trait segregate (separate) during gamete formation, so that each gamete receives only one allele for each trait. For example, a Tt plant will produce gametes with either the T or the t allele.
5.  **Law of Independent Assortment:** This law states that the alleles of different genes assort independently of one another during gamete formation. This applies to genes located on different chromosomes or far apart on the same chromosome.
6.  **Back cross vs. Test cross:** A back cross is a cross between an F1 hybrid and one of its parents. A test cross is a specific type of back cross where the F1 hybrid is crossed with its homozygous recessive parent.
7.  **Punnett square:** A Punnett square is a diagram that is used to predict the genotypes of a particular cross or breeding experiment. It is a simple graphical way of discovering all of the potential combinations of genotypes that can occur in children, given the genotypes of their parents.
8.  **Genotype vs. Phenotype:** Genotype is the genetic makeup of an organism (e.g., Tt). Phenotype is the observable physical properties of an organism (e.g., tall).
9.  **Homozygous vs. Heterozygous:** Homozygous means having two identical alleles for a particular gene (e.g., TT or tt). Heterozygous means having two different alleles for a particular gene (e.g., Tt).
10. **Incomplete dominance:** Incomplete dominance is a form of intermediate inheritance in which one allele for a specific trait is not completely expressed over its paired allele. For example, in snapdragons, a cross between a red-flowered plant (RR) and a white-flowered plant (rr) results in an F1 generation of all pink-flowered plants (Rr).
11. **Codominance in ABO blood groups:** In the ABO blood group system, the I<sup>A</sup> and I<sup>B</sup> alleles are codominant. This means that if an individual inherits both alleles (genotype I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>B</sup>), both A and B antigens will be produced on the surface of their red blood cells, resulting in the AB blood type.
12. **Multiple alleles:** Multiple alleles exist in a population when there are many variations of a gene present. The ABO blood group system is an example, with three alleles (I<sup>A</sup>, I<sup>B</sup>, and i).
13. **Polygenic inheritance:** Polygenic inheritance occurs when one characteristic is controlled by two or more genes. Human skin color and height are examples.
14. **Pleiotropy:** Pleiotropy occurs when one gene influences two or more seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits. For example, the gene for phenylketonuria (PKU) can cause mental retardation and reduced hair and skin pigmentation.
15. **Importance of pedigree analysis:** Pedigree analysis is important for studying the inheritance patterns of traits in humans, particularly genetic disorders. It can help determine whether a trait is dominant or recessive, and whether it is autosomal or sex-linked.
16. **Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance:** This theory states that genes are located on chromosomes and that the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis accounts for inheritance patterns.
17. **XY type of sex determination:** In this system, females have two of the same kind of sex chromosome (XX), while males have two distinct sex chromosomes (XY). The male is the heterogametic sex.
18. **ZW type of sex determination:** In this system, males have two of the same kind of sex chromosome (ZZ), while females have two distinct sex chromosomes (ZW). The female is the heterogametic sex.
19. **Haplodiploidy:** This is a sex-determination system in which males develop from unfertilized eggs and are haploid, and females develop from fertilized eggs and are diploid. This is seen in bees, wasps, and ants.
20. **Linkage:** Linkage is the tendency of genes that are located close to each other on a chromosome to be inherited together during meiosis.
21. **Crossing over and its significance:** Crossing over is the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes that results in recombinant chromosomes. It is a major source of genetic variation.
22. **Crossing over frequency and gene distance:** The frequency of crossing over between two genes is proportional to the distance between them on the chromosome. The farther apart the genes, the higher the frequency of recombination.
23. **Spontaneous and induced mutations:** Spontaneous mutations are random changes in the DNA that occur without a known cause. Induced mutations are caused by exposure to mutagens, such as radiation or chemicals.
24. **Point mutations:** Point mutations are changes in a single nucleotide of DNA. An example is sickle-cell anemia, which is caused by a single nucleotide substitution in the beta-globin gene.
25. **Frameshift mutations:** Frameshift mutations are genetic mutations caused by insertions or deletions of a number of nucleotides in a DNA sequence that is not divisible by three. This alters the reading frame of the entire subsequent sequence.
26. **Sex-linked inheritance in *Drosophila*:** T.H. Morgan's work on *Drosophila* showed that the gene for eye color was located on the X chromosome. This was the first experimental evidence for sex-linked inheritance.
27. **Haemophilia as a sex-linked disorder:** Haemophilia is an X-linked recessive disorder. This means that the gene for haemophilia is on the X chromosome, and the allele for the disorder is recessive to the normal allele. It is more common in males because they only have one X chromosome.
28. **Color blindness and its inheritance pattern:** Color blindness is also an X-linked recessive disorder. Like haemophilia, it is more common in males.
29. **Characteristics of Mendelian disorders:** Mendelian disorders are caused by mutations in a single gene. They are inherited in a predictable pattern (dominant, recessive, autosomal, or sex-linked).
30. **Thalassemia as a genetic disorder:** Thalassemia is an autosomal recessive blood disorder characterized by less hemoglobin and fewer red blood cells in the body than normal.
31. **Sickle-cell anaemia and its molecular basis:** Sickle-cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a point mutation in the beta-globin gene, which results in the substitution of a single amino acid (glutamic acid is replaced by valine). This causes the hemoglobin to polymerize under low oxygen conditions, leading to the sickling of red blood cells.
32. **PKU and its effects:** Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism that results in decreased metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine. If untreated, PKU can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, behavioral problems, and mental disorders.
33. **Causes of chromosomal disorders:** Chromosomal disorders are caused by errors in the number or structure of chromosomes. These errors can occur during meiosis or mitosis.
34. **Down's syndrome and its characteristics:** Down's syndrome is caused by trisomy 21 (an extra copy of chromosome 21). Characteristics include intellectual disability, a characteristic facial appearance, and weak muscle tone.
35. **Turner's syndrome and its symptoms:** Turner's syndrome is a chromosomal disorder in which a female is born with only one X chromosome (XO). Symptoms include short stature, a webbed neck, and underdeveloped ovaries.
36. **Klinefelter's syndrome and its effects:** Klinefelter's syndrome is a chromosomal disorder in which a male is born with an extra X chromosome (XXY). Effects can include weaker muscles, greater height, poor coordination, less body hair, smaller genitals, and breast growth.
37. **Autosomal vs. sex-linked inheritance:** Autosomal inheritance involves genes on autosomes (non-sex chromosomes), while sex-linked inheritance involves genes on the sex chromosomes (X and Y).
38. **Concept of genetic mapping:** Genetic mapping is the process of determining the linear sequence of genes on a chromosome.
39. **Significance of test cross in genetics:** A test cross is used to determine the genotype of an organism that shows a dominant phenotype. It is also used to determine the linkage between genes.
40. **Molecular basis of dominance and recessiveness:** Dominance is determined by the protein product of the alleles. A dominant allele will produce a functional protein, while a recessive allele may produce a non-functional protein or no protein at all.
41. **Pattern of inheritance in incomplete dominance:** In incomplete dominance, the F1 generation has a phenotype that is intermediate between the two parental phenotypes. The F2 generation has a 1:2:1 phenotypic ratio.
42. **Multiple alleles vs. polygenes:** Multiple alleles refer to more than two alleles for a single gene in a population. Polygenes refer to multiple genes that control a single trait.
43. **Genetic basis of ABO blood group system:** The ABO blood group system is controlled by three alleles: I<sup>A</sup>, I<sup>B</sup>, and i. I<sup>A</sup> and I<sup>B</sup> are codominant, and both are dominant to i.
44. **Genetic load:** Genetic load is the presence of unfavorable genetic material in the genes of a population.
45. **Qualitative vs. quantitative traits:** Qualitative traits are those that are expressed in discrete categories (e.g., blood type). Quantitative traits are those that are expressed on a continuous scale (e.g., height).
46. **Role of environment in gene expression:** The environment can influence the expression of genes. For example, the Himalayan rabbit has black fur on its extremities due to the lower temperature in those areas.
47. **Expressivity and penetrance:** Expressivity is the degree to which a trait is expressed. Penetrance is the proportion of individuals with a particular genotype that show the expected phenotype.
48. **Significance of Morgan's work on *Drosophila*:** Morgan's work on *Drosophila* provided the first experimental evidence for the chromosomal theory of inheritance and for sex-linked inheritance.
49. **Structure of a typical pedigree chart:** A pedigree chart uses standard symbols to represent males, females, affected individuals, and the relationships between them.
50. **Concept of genetic counseling:** Genetic counseling is the process of advising individuals and families affected by or at risk of genetic disorders to help them understand and adapt to the medical, psychological, and familial implications of genetic contributions to disease.
51. **Methods of sex determination in different organisms:** Different organisms have different methods of sex determination, including the XY system (humans), the ZW system (birds), haplodiploidy (bees), and environmental sex determination (some reptiles).
52. **Significance of crossing over in evolution:** Crossing over is a major source of genetic variation, which is the raw material for evolution.
53. **Types of chromosomal mutations:** Chromosomal mutations include deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations.
54. **Lethal genes:** Lethal genes are genes that cause the death of the organism that carries them.

### Part D: Long Answer Questions
1.  **Mendel's Monohybrid Cross:** Mendel performed a monohybrid cross by first taking a purebred tall pea plant (TT) and a purebred dwarf pea plant (tt) as the parental (P) generation. He cross-pollinated them to produce the first filial (F1) generation. All offspring in the F1 generation were tall (genotype Tt). This observation led to the **Law of Dominance**, as the tall trait masked the dwarf trait. Next, Mendel allowed the F1 plants to self-pollinate. In the resulting F2 generation, he observed both tall and dwarf plants in a ratio of approximately 3:1. This reappearance of the dwarf trait led to the **Law of Segregation**, which states that the two alleles for each trait segregate (separate) during gamete formation, so that each gamete receives only one allele for each trait.
2.  **Mendel's Dihybrid Cross:** Mendel performed a dihybrid cross by crossing a pea plant that was homozygous for round, yellow seeds (RRYY) with a pea plant that was homozygous for wrinkled, green seeds (rryy). The F1 generation all had round, yellow seeds (RrYy). When the F1 generation was self-pollinated, the F2 generation had a phenotypic ratio of 9:3:3:1 (round yellow: round green: wrinkled yellow: wrinkled green). This showed that the alleles for seed shape and seed color assorted independently of one another, which led to the **Law of Independent Assortment**.
3.  **Incomplete Dominance:** Incomplete dominance is a form of intermediate inheritance in which one allele for a specific trait is not completely expressed over its paired allele. This results in a third phenotype in which the expressed physical trait is a combination of the phenotypes of both alleles. For example, in snapdragons, a cross between a red-flowered plant (RR) and a white-flowered plant (rr) results in an F1 generation of all pink-flowered plants (Rr). This differs from complete dominance, where the F1 generation would all show the dominant trait (e.g., all red flowers). When the pink (Rr) F1 plants are self-crossed, the F2 generation has a phenotypic ratio of 1 Red : 2 Pink : 1 White.
4.  **ABO Blood Group System:** The ABO blood group in humans is a classic example of both **codominance** and **multiple alleles**. The system is controlled by a single gene, the 'I' gene, which has three different alleles: I<sup>A</sup>, I<sup>B</sup>, and i. An individual inherits two of these three alleles. The I<sup>A</sup> and I<sup>B</sup> alleles are dominant over the 'i' allele. However, when I<sup>A</sup> and I<sup>B</sup> are inherited together, they are codominant, meaning both are fully expressed, resulting in the AB blood type. This demonstrates codominance. The fact that there are three possible alleles (I<sup>A</sup>, I<sup>B</sup>, i) in the population for this single gene demonstrates multiple alleles.
5.  **Polygenic Inheritance:** Polygenic inheritance occurs when one characteristic is controlled by two or more genes. Often the genes are large in quantity but small in effect. Examples of human polygenic inheritance are height, skin color, eye color and weight. This differs from single gene inheritance, where a single gene controls the trait.
6.  **Pleiotropy:** Pleiotropy occurs when one gene influences two or more seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits. Such a gene that exhibits multiple phenotypic expression is called a pleiotropic gene. For example, phenylketonuria (PKU) is a disease caused by a mutation in a single gene that codes for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme is necessary to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine. A lack of this enzyme can lead to mental retardation, eczema, and pigment defects.
7.  **Pedigree Analysis:** Pedigree analysis is the study of an inherited trait in a group of related individuals to determine the pattern and characteristics of the trait, including its mode of inheritance, age of onset, and expressivity. It is a graphical representation of a family tree that shows the inheritance of a trait or disease through several generations. It can be used to determine whether a trait is dominant or recessive, and whether it is autosomal or sex-linked.
8.  **Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance:** The Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance states that genes are found at specific locations on chromosomes, and that the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis can explain Mendel's laws of inheritance. It was proposed by Walter Sutton and Theodor Boveri.
9.  **Sex Determination Mechanisms:** Different organisms have different mechanisms for sex determination. In humans, it is the XY system, where females are XX and males are XY. In birds, it is the ZW system, where females are ZW and males are ZZ. In bees, it is haplodiploidy, where females are diploid and males are haploid.
10. **Linkage and Crossing Over:** Linkage is the tendency of genes that are located close to each other on a chromosome to be inherited together. Crossing over is the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes that results in recombinant chromosomes. Crossing over can break up linkages between genes.
11. **Mutations:** A mutation is a change in the DNA sequence of an organism. Mutations can be caused by errors in DNA replication, exposure to mutagens, or viral infection. Mutations can be beneficial, harmful, or neutral. They are the ultimate source of all genetic variation.
12. **Sex-Linked Inheritance:** Sex-linked inheritance is the inheritance of a trait that is determined by a gene located on one of the sex chromosomes. In humans, this is usually the X chromosome. Examples include hemophilia and red-green color blindness. In *Drosophila*, eye color is a sex-linked trait.
13. **Haemophilia:** Haemophilia is an X-linked recessive disorder that affects the body's ability to control blood clotting. It is more common in males than in females. A male with the haemophilia allele on his X chromosome will have the disorder, while a female must have the allele on both of her X chromosomes to have the disorder.
14. **Thalassemia:** Thalassemia is an autosomal recessive blood disorder that is characterized by the production of an abnormal form of hemoglobin. This results in the excessive destruction of red blood cells, which leads to anemia.
15. **Sickle-Cell Anaemia:** Sickle-cell anemia is an autosomal recessive blood disorder that is caused by a point mutation in the beta-globin gene. This mutation causes the hemoglobin to be misshapen, which in turn causes the red blood cells to be sickle-shaped. These sickle-shaped cells can block blood flow, causing pain and organ damage.
16. **PKU:** Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism that is caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme is necessary to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine. Without this enzyme, phenylalanine builds up in the body and can cause mental retardation and other health problems. Treatment involves a diet that is low in phenylalanine.
17. **Chromosomal Disorders:** Chromosomal disorders are caused by changes in the number or structure of chromosomes. These changes can be inherited from a parent or can occur spontaneously. Examples of chromosomal disorders include Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, and Klinefelter syndrome.
18. **Down's Syndrome:** Down syndrome is a chromosomal disorder that is caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21. This is also known as trisomy 21. People with Down syndrome have a distinct facial appearance, intellectual disability, and developmental delays.
19. **Turner's and Klinefelter's Syndromes:** Turner syndrome is a chromosomal disorder that affects females. It is caused by the absence of one of the X chromosomes. Klinefelter syndrome is a chromosomal disorder that affects males. It is caused by the presence of an extra X chromosome.
20. **Genetic Mapping:** Genetic mapping is the process of determining the location of genes on a chromosome. This can be done by using the frequency of recombination between genes. The farther apart two genes are on a chromosome, the more likely they are to be separated by recombination.
21. **Historical Development of Genetics:** The field of genetics began with the work of Gregor Mendel in the 19th century. Mendel's work was rediscovered in the early 20th century, and this led to the development of the chromosomal theory of inheritance. In the mid-20th century, the structure of DNA was discovered, and this led to the development of molecular genetics.
