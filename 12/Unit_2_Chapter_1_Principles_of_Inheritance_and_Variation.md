# Unit 2: Genetics and Evolution - Chapter 1: Principles of Inheritance and Variation

## 2.1 Principles of Inheritance and Variation

### Heredity and Variation

*   **Heredity:** The process by which characters (traits) are passed on from parent to progeny. It is the basis of inheritance.
*   **Variation:** The degree by which progeny differ from their parents. Variations arise due to crossing over, mutation, recombination, and environmental influences.

### Mendel’s Laws of Inheritance

Gregor Johann Mendel (1822-1884), known as the "Father of Genetics," conducted hybridization experiments on garden peas (*Pisum sativum*) for seven years (1856-1863) and proposed the laws of inheritance.

*   **Monohybrid Cross:** A cross involving a single pair of contrasting characters.
    *   **Law of Dominance:** States that in a heterozygous individual, only one allele (the dominant allele) expresses itself, while the other (recessive allele) remains unexpressed. The characters are controlled by discrete units called factors (now known as genes).
    *   **Law of Segregation (Law of Purity of Gametes):** States that the two alleles of a gene separate (segregate) from each other during gamete formation, such that each gamete receives only one allele. These alleles do not blend.

*   **Dihybrid Cross:** A cross involving two pairs of contrasting characters.
    *   **Law of Independent Assortment:** States that when two pairs of traits are combined in a hybrid, segregation of one pair of characters is independent of the other pair of characters. This law applies to genes located on different chromosomes or far apart on the same chromosome.

*   **Back Cross:** A cross between an F1 hybrid and either of its parents.
*   **Test Cross:** A cross between an F1 hybrid and its recessive parent. It is used to determine the genotype of an individual showing the dominant phenotype (whether it is homozygous dominant or heterozygous).

*   **Punnett Square:** A graphical representation to calculate the probability of all possible genotypes and phenotypes of offspring in a genetic cross. Developed by Reginald C. Punnett.

### Terms: Gene, Allele, Homo/Heterozygous, Dominant/Recessive, Genotype/Phenotype

*   **Gene:** A unit of inheritance; a segment of DNA that codes for a particular trait.
*   **Allele:** Alternative forms of a gene (e.g., T for tall, t for dwarf).
*   **Homozygous:** An individual having identical alleles for a particular trait (e.g., TT or tt).
*   **Heterozygous:** An individual having two different alleles for a particular trait (e.g., Tt).
*   **Dominant Allele:** An allele that expresses its phenotype even in the presence of a recessive allele.
*   **Recessive Allele:** An allele that expresses its phenotype only when present in a homozygous state.
*   **Genotype:** The genetic constitution of an individual (e.g., TT, Tt, tt).
*   **Phenotype:** The observable characteristics of an individual, determined by its genotype and environment (e.g., Tall, Dwarf).

### Deviations from Mendelian Inheritance

1.  **Incomplete Dominance:**
    *   Neither allele is completely dominant over the other, resulting in a blended phenotype in the heterozygote.
    *   **Example:** Flower color in Snapdragon (*Antirrhinum majus*) or Four O'clock plant (*Mirabilis jalapa*).
        *   Red (RR) x White (rr) → Pink (Rr) in F1 generation.
        *   F2 phenotypic and genotypic ratio is 1:2:1 (Red:Pink:White).

2.  **Codominance:**
    *   Both alleles express themselves fully in the heterozygote.
    *   **Example:** ABO blood group system in humans.
        *   Controlled by gene I, which has three alleles: I^A, I^B, and i.
        *   I^A and I^B are codominant, while i is recessive to both.
        *   Genotype I^A I^B results in AB blood group, where both A and B antigens are expressed.

3.  **Multiple Alleles:**
    *   More than two alleles exist for a single gene in a population.
    *   **Example:** ABO blood group system (I^A, I^B, i).

4.  **Polygenic Inheritance:**
    *   A trait controlled by three or more genes (multiple genes).
    *   The phenotype reflects the additive effect of multiple genes.
    *   **Example:** Human skin color, human height.

5.  **Pleiotropy:**
    *   A single gene affects multiple phenotypic traits.
    *   **Example:**
        *   **Phenylketonuria (PKU):** A single gene mutation leads to mental retardation, reduction in hair and skin pigmentation.
        *   **Starch synthesis in pea seeds:** A single gene controls both seed shape (round/wrinkled) and starch grain size.

### Pedigree Analysis

*   **Pedigree Analysis:** The study of inheritance patterns of genetic traits in humans (or other organisms) by analyzing the family history over several generations.
*   **Symbols:** Standardized symbols are used to represent individuals, their sex, affected status, and relationships.
*   **Interpretation:** Used to determine the mode of inheritance (autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked dominant, X-linked recessive) of a genetic disorder.

### Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance

*   Proposed by Walter Sutton and Theodor Boveri in 1902.
*   States that Mendelian factors (genes) are located on chromosomes.
*   Key points:
    *   Chromosomes, like genes, occur in pairs.
    *   Homologous chromosomes separate during meiosis, and each gamete receives one chromosome from each pair.
    *   The pairing and separation of a pair of chromosomes would lead to the segregation of a pair of factors they carry.

### Sex Determination

*   The mechanism by which the sex of an individual is determined.
*   **Humans (XY type):**
    *   Males are heterogametic (XY), producing two types of sperm (X and Y).
    *   Females are homogametic (XX), producing only one type of egg (X).
    *   Sex of the offspring is determined by the sperm that fertilizes the egg.
*   **Birds (ZW type):**
    *   Females are heterogametic (ZW), producing two types of eggs (Z and W).
    *   Males are homogametic (ZZ), producing only one type of sperm (Z).
    *   Sex of the offspring is determined by the egg.
*   **Honeybee (Haplodiploidy):**
    *   Males (drones) develop from unfertilized eggs and are haploid (n).
    *   Females (queens and workers) develop from fertilized eggs and are diploid (2n).
    *   Sex is determined by the number of sets of chromosomes.
*   **Grasshopper (XO type):**
    *   Males are XO (have only one X chromosome).
    *   Females are XX.
    *   Sex of the offspring is determined by the sperm (X-carrying or O-carrying).

### Linkage and Crossing Over

*   **Linkage:** The phenomenon where genes located on the same chromosome tend to be inherited together and do not assort independently.
    *   Discovered by T.H. Morgan in *Drosophila melanogaster*.
    *   Linked genes are located close together on the same chromosome.
*   **Crossing Over:** The exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes during meiosis (prophase I).
    *   Leads to recombination (new combinations of genes).
    *   The frequency of crossing over between two linked genes is directly proportional to the distance between them on the chromosome. This is used for genetic mapping.

### Mutation

*   **Mutation:** A sudden heritable change in the DNA sequence.
*   **Spontaneous Mutations:** Occur naturally due to errors during DNA replication or repair.
*   **Induced Mutations:** Caused by mutagens (physical, chemical, or biological agents).
*   **Point Mutations:** Changes in a single base pair of DNA.
    *   **Transition:** Replacement of a purine by a purine (A↔G) or a pyrimidine by a pyrimidine (C↔T).
    *   **Transversion:** Replacement of a purine by a pyrimidine or vice versa (A↔C, A↔T, G↔C, G↔T).
    *   **Frameshift Mutations:** Insertions or deletions of base pairs that alter the reading frame of the genetic code, leading to a completely different protein sequence.

### Sex-linked Inheritance

*   Inheritance of genes located on the sex chromosomes (X or Y).
*   **In *Drosophila*:** Morgan studied sex-linked inheritance of eye color.
*   **In Humans:**
    *   **Haemophilia (Bleeder's Disease):** X-linked recessive disorder. Affected individuals lack a clotting factor, leading to prolonged bleeding.
    *   **Colour Blindness:** X-linked recessive disorder. Affected individuals cannot distinguish between certain colors (most commonly red and green).

### Mendelian Disorders

*   Genetic disorders caused by alteration or mutation in a single gene.
*   **Thalassemia:** Autosomal recessive blood disorder characterized by reduced synthesis of globin chains of hemoglobin, leading to anemia.
*   **Sickle-cell Anaemia:** Autosomal recessive blood disorder. A point mutation in the beta-globin gene leads to the substitution of glutamic acid by valine, causing red blood cells to become sickle-shaped under low oxygen tension.
*   **Phenylketonuria (PKU):** Autosomal recessive metabolic disorder. Deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, leading to accumulation of phenylalanine and its derivatives, causing mental retardation.

### Chromosomal Disorders

*   Caused by absence or excess or abnormal arrangement of one or more chromosomes.
*   **Down’s Syndrome (Trisomy 21):** Caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21 (47, XX or XY, +21). Symptoms include mental retardation, short stature, characteristic facial features.
*   **Turner’s Syndrome (XO):** Caused by the absence of one X chromosome in females (45, XO). Symptoms include sterile females, rudimentary ovaries, lack of secondary sexual characteristics.
*   **Klinefelter’s Syndrome (XXY):** Caused by the presence of an extra X chromosome in males (47, XXY). Symptoms include overall masculine development but with feminine features (e.g., gynecomastia), sterile males.
