### Section B

2.  **Biopiracy:** The use of bio-resources by multinational companies and other organisations without proper authorisation from the countries and people concerned without compensatory payment. Example: The patenting of neem and turmeric by foreign companies.
3.  **Lymphocytes:**
    *   **B-lymphocytes:** Produce antibodies to fight pathogens.
    *   **T-lymphocytes:** Help B-lymphocytes to produce antibodies, and also directly kill infected cells.
