## Specimen Prep Guide: Biotechnology and Its Applications

### Key Concepts (Recall & Understanding)

*   **Agriculture:** Understand the applications of biotechnology in agriculture, including the production of pest-resistant plants (Bt cotton), and the use of RNA interference (RNAi) to develop pest-resistant plants.
*   **Medicine:** Know the applications in medicine, such as the production of genetically engineered insulin, gene therapy, and molecular diagnosis.
*   **Transgenic Animals:** Understand the purpose of creating transgenic animals (e.g., Rosie the cow).
*   **Ethical Issues:** Be aware of the ethical issues related to biotechnology, such as biopiracy and the role of GEAC (Genetic Engineering Approval Committee).

### Application Corner

*   **Problem Type:** Explaining how biotechnology can be used to solve a specific problem (e.g., how to produce insulin for diabetic patients).
*   **Example:** How does gene therapy work? (It involves the replacement of a defective gene with a normal, healthy gene).

### Analytical Thinking

*   **Scenario:** A farmer is facing heavy crop losses due to a pest infestation. How can biotechnology help?
*   **Analysis:** The farmer can use genetically modified crops like Bt cotton, which are resistant to certain pests. This will reduce the need for chemical pesticides.
*   **Ethical Debate:** Be able to discuss the pros and cons of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).

### Key Case Study

*   **Bt Cotton:** This is a genetically modified crop that contains a gene from the bacterium *Bacillus thuringiensis*. This gene produces a protein that is toxic to certain insects, thus protecting the plant from pests like bollworms.

### Assertion-Reason Practice

1.  **Assertion:** RNA interference (RNAi) is a method of cellular defense.
    **Reason:** It involves the silencing of a specific mRNA due to a complementary dsRNA molecule.
    *   **(a) Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation for Assertion.**

2.  **Assertion:** The first transgenic cow, Rosie, produced human protein-enriched milk.
    **Reason:** The milk contained the human alpha-lactalbumin and was more nutritionally balanced for human babies than natural cow milk.
    *   **(a) Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation for Assertion.**

### HOTS (Higher-Order Thinking Skills) Question

*   What is biopiracy? Give an example.
    *   **Answer:** Biopiracy is the term used to refer to the use of bio-resources by multinational companies and other organisations without proper authorisation from the countries and people concerned without compensatory payment. An example is the patenting of the use of turmeric and neem for medicinal purposes by foreign companies.
