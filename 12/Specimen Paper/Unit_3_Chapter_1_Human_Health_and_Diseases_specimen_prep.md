## Specimen Prep Guide: Human Health and Diseases

### Key Concepts (Recall & Understanding)

*   **Common Diseases:** Know the causative agents, symptoms, and modes of transmission of common diseases like typhoid, pneumonia, common cold, malaria, amoebiasis, ascariasis, and filariasis.
*   **Immunity:** Differentiate between innate and acquired immunity, and active and passive immunity. Understand the structure of an antibody and the roles of B-cells and T-cells.
*   **AIDS & Cancer:** Understand the cause, transmission, and prevention of AIDS. Know the difference between benign and malignant tumors and the causes and treatment of cancer.
*   **Drugs & Alcohol Abuse:** Understand the effects of drug and alcohol abuse.

### Application Corner

*   **Problem Type:** Identifying a disease based on a given set of symptoms. Suggesting preventive measures for a particular disease.
*   **Example:** A patient presents with high fever, weakness, stomach pain, and constipation. Which disease is he likely suffering from? (Answer: Typhoid).

### Analytical Thinking

*   **Scenario:** Why does a person who has had chickenpox once in their life rarely get it again?
*   **Analysis:** This is due to acquired immunity. The body produces memory B-cells and T-cells after the first infection, which can quickly recognize and fight off the virus if it enters the body again.
*   **Diagram Interpretation:** Be able to interpret the life cycle of the malarial parasite (*Plasmodium*).

### Key Case Study

*   **Vaccination:** Understand the principle of vaccination. Vaccines work by introducing a weakened or inactivated pathogen or a part of a pathogen into the body to stimulate an immune response and the production of memory cells.

### Assertion-Reason Practice

1.  **Assertion:** An antibody is a protein molecule.
    **Reason:** It is made up of four polypeptide chains.
    *   **(a) Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation for Assertion.**

2.  **Assertion:** Colostrum provides passive immunity to the newborn baby.
    **Reason:** It contains pre-formed antibodies.
    *   **(a) Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation for Assertion.**

### HOTS (Higher-Order Thinking Skills) Question

*   Why is it difficult to make a vaccine against the common cold?
    *   **Answer:** The common cold is caused by a large number of different viruses (rhinoviruses), and these viruses mutate frequently. This makes it difficult to create a single vaccine that would be effective against all of them.
