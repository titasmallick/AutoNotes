## Specimen Prep Guide: Pedigree Analysis

### Key Concepts (Recall & Understanding)

*   **Pedigree Symbols:** Know the standard symbols used in a pedigree chart.
*   **Patterns of Inheritance:** Understand how to identify autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked dominant, and X-linked recessive inheritance patterns from a pedigree chart.

### Application Corner

*   **Problem Type:** Analyzing a given pedigree chart to determine the mode of inheritance of a trait.
*   **Example:** If a trait appears in every generation and affects both males and females, it is likely an autosomal dominant trait.

### Analytical Thinking

*   **Scenario:** In a pedigree chart, a trait is more common in males than females and skips generations. What is the likely mode of inheritance?
*   **Analysis:** X-linked recessive.

### Key Case Study

*   **Genetic Counseling:** Pedigree analysis is a very important tool for genetic counselors to advise couples about the risk of genetic disorders in their offspring.

### Assertion-Reason Practice

1.  **Assertion:** In a pedigree for an X-linked recessive trait, affected mothers have affected sons.
    **Reason:** The son inherits his only X chromosome from his mother.
    *   **(a) Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation for Assertion.**

### HOTS (Higher-Order Thinking Skills) Question

*   Can an autosomal dominant trait skip a generation? Why or why not?
    *   **Answer:** No, an autosomal dominant trait cannot skip a generation because an affected individual must have at least one affected parent.
