## Specimen Prep Guide: Evolution

### Key Concepts (Recall & Understanding)

*   **Origin of Life:** Understand the theories of the origin of life, including the theory of chemical evolution proposed by Oparin and Haldane.
*   **Evidences for Evolution:** Know the evidences from paleontology, comparative anatomy (homologous and analogous organs), embryology, and molecular biology.
*   **Theories of Evolution:** Understand Lamarckism, Darwinism (natural selection), and the modern synthetic theory of evolution.
*   **Hardy-Weinberg Principle:** Know the principle and the factors that affect it (gene flow, genetic drift, mutation, natural selection).
*   **Human Evolution:** Know the major stages of human evolution.

### Application Corner

*   **Problem Type:** Applying the Hardy-Weinberg principle to calculate allele and genotype frequencies in a population.
*   **Example:** If the frequency of a recessive allele is 0.4, what is the frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype? (Answer: p² = (0.6)² = 0.36 or 36%).

### Analytical Thinking

*   **Scenario:** The peppered moth population in England changed from being predominantly light-colored to dark-colored after the industrial revolution. Explain this phenomenon.
*   **Analysis:** This is an example of natural selection. The dark-colored moths were better camouflaged against the soot-covered trees and were less likely to be eaten by predators.
*   **Diagram Interpretation:** Be able to interpret diagrams showing homologous and analogous structures.

### Key Case Study

*   **Darwin's Finches:** The finches on the Galapagos Islands are a classic example of adaptive radiation. They evolved from a common ancestor but adapted to different food sources on different islands, leading to the evolution of different beak shapes.

### Assertion-Reason Practice

1.  **Assertion:** Homologous organs suggest a common ancestry.
    **Reason:** They have a similar basic structure but perform different functions.
    *   **(a) Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation for Assertion.**

2.  **Assertion:** Genetic drift is more likely to occur in small populations.
    **Reason:** In a small population, random events can have a greater impact on allele frequencies.
    *   **(a) Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation for Assertion.**

### HOTS (Higher-Order Thinking Skills) Question

*   How does the modern synthetic theory of evolution differ from Darwin's theory of natural selection?
    *   **Answer:** The modern synthetic theory incorporates our understanding of genetics (mutations, recombination, genetic drift) into Darwin's theory of natural selection. It provides a more complete explanation of the sources of variation and the mechanisms of evolution.
