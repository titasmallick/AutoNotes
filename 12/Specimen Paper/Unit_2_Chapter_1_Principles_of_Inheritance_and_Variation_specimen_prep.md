## Specimen Prep Guide: Principles of Inheritance and Variation

### Key Concepts (Recall & Understanding)

*   **Mendel's Laws:** Understand the Law of Dominance, Law of Segregation, and Law of Independent Assortment.
*   **Deviations from Mendelism:** Know about incomplete dominance, co-dominance, multiple alleles, and pleiotropy.
*   **Chromosomal Theory:** Understand the contribution of Sutton and Boveri.
*   **Sex Determination:** Know the mechanisms of sex determination in humans, birds, and honeybees.
*   **Genetic Disorders:** Differentiate between Mendelian disorders (e.g., haemophilia, sickle-cell anemia) and chromosomal disorders (e.g., Down's syndrome, Turner's syndrome).

### Application Corner

*   **Problem Type:** Solving monohybrid, dihybrid, and test cross problems. Analyzing pedigree charts to determine the pattern of inheritance.
*   **Example:** A man with blood group A marries a woman with blood group B. Their first child has blood group O. What is the probability of their next child having blood group AB? (Answer: 25%).

### Analytical Thinking

*   **Scenario:** A pedigree chart shows a trait appearing in every generation and affecting both males and females equally. What is the likely mode of inheritance?
*   **Analysis:** Autosomal dominant.
*   **Diagram Interpretation:** Be able to interpret a karyotype to identify chromosomal abnormalities.

### Key Experiment

*   **T.H. Morgan's work on *Drosophila melanogaster*:** His experiments on fruit flies established the chromosomal theory of inheritance and the concept of linkage and recombination.

### Assertion-Reason Practice

1.  **Assertion:** The law of dominance is not universally applicable.
    **Reason:** It is not applicable in cases of incomplete dominance and co-dominance.
    *   **(a) Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation for Assertion.**

2.  **Assertion:** A male human can never be a carrier of haemophilia.
    **Reason:** Haemophilia is a sex-linked recessive disorder, and males have only one X chromosome.
    *   **(a) Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation for Assertion.**

### HOTS (Higher-Order Thinking Skills) Question

*   A tall pea plant with round seeds (TtRr) is crossed with a dwarf pea plant with wrinkled seeds (ttrr). What percentage of the progeny will be tall with wrinkled seeds?
    *   **Answer:** 25%. The cross will produce four phenotypes (tall-round, tall-wrinkled, dwarf-round, dwarf-wrinkled) in the ratio 1:1:1:1.
