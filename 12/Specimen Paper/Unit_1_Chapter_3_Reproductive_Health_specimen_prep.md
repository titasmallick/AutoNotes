## Specimen Prep Guide: Reproductive Health

### Key Concepts (Recall & Understanding)

*   **Reproductive Health:** Understand the problems and strategies related to reproductive health in India.
*   **Contraception:** Know the different methods of contraception (natural, barrier, IUDs, oral, surgical) and their mechanisms of action.
*   **MTP & STDs:** Understand Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) and Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs).
*   **Infertility & ART:** Know the causes of infertility and the principles of Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) like IVF, ZIFT, GIFT, and ICSI.

### Application Corner

*   **Problem Type:** Choosing a suitable contraceptive method for a given couple based on their needs and health conditions.
*   **Example:** A couple wants to space their children. Which contraceptive method would you suggest? (An IUD would be a suitable long-term, reversible option).

### Analytical Thinking

*   **Scenario:** A person is diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease. What are the immediate steps they should take?
*   **Analysis:** They should consult a qualified doctor, complete the full course of treatment, and inform their sexual partner(s).
*   **Ethical Issues:** Be able to discuss the ethical, legal, and social issues related to MTP and ART.

### Key Case Study

*   **Amniocentesis:** Understand the procedure and its purpose (detecting genetic disorders). Also, understand why it is banned for sex determination to prevent female foeticide.

### Assertion-Reason Practice

1.  **Assertion:** Saheli, an oral contraceptive for females, contains a non-steroidal preparation.
    **Reason:** It is a 'once a week' pill with very few side effects.
    *   **(b) Both Assertion and Reason are true but Reason is not the correct explanation for Assertion.**

2.  **Assertion:** IUDs are ideal contraceptives for females who want to delay pregnancy.
    **Reason:** IUDs are effective, reversible, and need to be replaced only after a few years.
    *   **(a) Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation for Assertion.**

### HOTS (Higher-Order Thinking Skills) Question

*   Why is there a statutory ban on amniocentesis in India?
    *   **Answer:** To prevent its misuse for prenatal sex determination, which often leads to female foeticide, thus disturbing the sex ratio of the population.
