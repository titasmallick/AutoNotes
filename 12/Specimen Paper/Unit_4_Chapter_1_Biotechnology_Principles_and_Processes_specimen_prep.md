## Specimen Prep Guide: Biotechnology: Principles and Processes

### Key Concepts (Recall & Understanding)

*   **Principles of Biotechnology:** Understand the two core techniques: genetic engineering and maintenance of sterile conditions.
*   **Tools of Recombinant DNA Technology:** Know about restriction enzymes, cloning vectors, and competent hosts.
*   **Processes of Recombinant DNA Technology:** Understand the steps: isolation of DNA, cutting of DNA at specific locations, amplification of gene of interest using PCR, insertion of recombinant DNA into the host cell, and obtaining the foreign gene product.
*   **Bioreactors:** Know the importance of bioreactors in large-scale production.

### Application Corner

*   **Problem Type:** Designing the steps to create a recombinant DNA molecule for a specific purpose.
*   **Example:** How would you use PCR to amplify a gene of interest? (Describe the steps of denaturation, annealing, and extension).

### Analytical Thinking

*   **Scenario:** Why is it important to use the same restriction enzyme to cut both the vector DNA and the foreign DNA?
*   **Analysis:** To produce complementary sticky ends, which can then be joined together by DNA ligase.
*   **Diagram Interpretation:** Be able to interpret a diagram of a plasmid vector like pBR322, identifying the selectable markers and cloning sites.

### Key Case Study

*   **Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR):** Understand the principle and applications of PCR. It is a powerful technique used to amplify a small sample of DNA into a large amount, which can then be used for various purposes like DNA fingerprinting, disease diagnosis, and research.

### Assertion-Reason Practice

1.  **Assertion:** Restriction enzymes are also called "molecular scissors".
    **Reason:** They cut DNA at specific sites.
    *   **(a) Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation for Assertion.**

2.  **Assertion:** Plasmids are used as cloning vectors in genetic engineering.
    **Reason:** They are self-replicating and can carry a foreign gene into a host cell.
    *   **(a) Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation for Assertion.**

### HOTS (Higher-Order Thinking Skills) Question

*   What are "selectable markers" in a cloning vector, and what is their significance?
    *   **Answer:** Selectable markers are genes that help in identifying and eliminating non-transformants and selectively permitting the growth of the transformants. For example, the genes for antibiotic resistance in pBR322.
