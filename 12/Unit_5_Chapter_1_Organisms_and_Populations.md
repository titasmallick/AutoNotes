# Unit 5: Ecology and Environment - Chapter 1: Organisms and Populations

## 5.1 Organisms and Populations

### Definition of Population

A **population** is defined as a group of individuals of the same species living in a well-defined geographical area, sharing or competing for similar resources, and potentially interbreeding. For example, all the teakwood trees in a forest, all the rats in an abandoned dwelling, or all the lotus plants in a pond constitute a population.

### Population Attributes: Density, Sex Ratio, Natality, Mortality, Growth Models (Exponential, Logistic), Age Pyramids

Populations have certain characteristics or attributes that an individual organism does not. These include:

1.  **Population Density:**
    *   The number of individuals of a species per unit area or volume at a given time.
    *   It is not always measured in absolute numbers. For example, for a single banyan tree with a large canopy, counting the number of individuals of a bird species living on it might be more meaningful than just the number of trees.
    *   Formula: Population Density (D) = Total number of individuals (N) / Space (S) or Volume (V).

2.  **Sex Ratio:**
    *   The ratio of males to females in a population.
    *   Expressed as the number of females per 1000 males or vice versa.
    *   For example, 60% females and 40% males in a population.

3.  **Natality (Birth Rate):**
    *   The number of births per thousand individuals in a population per unit time.
    *   It is the increase in the number of individuals in a population under given environmental conditions.
    *   It adds new individuals to the population.

4.  **Mortality (Death Rate):**
    *   The number of deaths per thousand individuals in a population per unit time.
    *   It is the loss of individuals in a population due to death.
    *   It decreases the population size.

5.  **Growth Models:**
    *   The size of a population changes depending on food availability, predation pressure, and adverse weather conditions.
    *   The change in population density (N) over time (t) is given by:
        `dN/dt = (b + i) - (d + e)`
        Where: `b` = birth rate, `i` = immigration, `d` = death rate, `e` = emigration.

    *   **a. Exponential Growth Model:**
        *   Occurs when resources (food, space) are unlimited.
        *   Each species has the ability to realize its full innate potential to grow (r = intrinsic rate of natural increase).
        *   Equation: `dN/dt = rN`
        *   Where: `N` = Population size, `t` = Time, `r` = Intrinsic rate of natural increase.
        *   The `r` value is a measure of the maximum potential for population growth under ideal conditions.
        *   The curve obtained is J-shaped.
        *   `Nt = N0 * e^(rt)`
        *   Where: `Nt` = Population density after time t, `N0` = Population density at time 0, `r` = Intrinsic rate of natural increase, `e` = Base of natural logarithms (2.71828).

    *   **b. Logistic Growth Model:**
        *   Occurs when resources are limited, which is a more realistic scenario in nature.
        *   No population can grow exponentially indefinitely.
        *   The environment has a carrying capacity (K), which is the maximum population size that the environment can sustain indefinitely given the available resources.
        *   Equation: `dN/dt = rN * ((K - N) / K)`
        *   Where: `K` = Carrying capacity.
        *   The curve obtained is S-shaped (Sigmoid curve).
        *   Phases:
            *   **Lag phase:** Slow initial growth.
            *   **Log (exponential) phase:** Rapid growth.
            *   **Stationary phase:** Population density reaches carrying capacity (K), and growth slows down and eventually stops.

6.  **Age Pyramids (Age Distribution):**
    *   The proportion of individuals of different age groups in a population.
    *   Usually, three age groups are considered: pre-reproductive, reproductive, and post-reproductive.
    *   The shape of the age pyramid indicates the growth status of the population:
        *   **Expanding (Triangular):** High proportion of young individuals, indicating a growing population.
        *   **Stable (Bell-shaped):** Even distribution of pre-reproductive and reproductive individuals, indicating a stable population.
        *   **Declining (Urn-shaped):** Low proportion of young individuals, indicating a declining population.

### Population Interactions:

Species interact with each other in various ways within a community. These interactions can be beneficial, detrimental, or neutral to one or both species involved.

1.  **Mutualism (+/+):**
    *   Both interacting species benefit.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   **Lichens:** Association between a fungus and photosynthetic algae/cyanobacteria. Fungus provides protection and absorption, algae/cyanobacteria provide food.
        *   **Mycorrhizae:** Association between fungi and roots of higher plants. Fungi help in nutrient absorption, plants provide carbohydrates.
        *   **Pollination:** Animals (e.g., bees, birds) get nectar/pollen, plants get pollinated.
        *   **Fig and Wasp:** Wasp pollinates the fig flower, and the fig provides food and a place for the wasp to lay eggs.
        *   **Rhizobium in leguminous plants:** Bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen for the plant, and the plant provides shelter and nutrients.

2.  **Competition (-/-):**
    *   Both interacting species are harmed due to competition for limited resources.
    *   **Types:**
        *   **Interference Competition:** Direct aggressive interaction between individuals.
        *   **Exploitative Competition:** Indirect competition where one species consumes a shared resource, making it unavailable for others.
    *   **Competitive Exclusion Principle (Gause's Principle):** Two closely related species competing for the same limited resources cannot coexist indefinitely; the competitively superior one will eventually eliminate the other.
    *   **Resource Partitioning:** Species competing for the same resources can avoid competition by choosing different times for feeding or different foraging patterns.

3.  **Predation (+/-):**
    *   One species (predator) kills and consumes another species (prey).
    *   **Importance:**
        *   Transfer energy across trophic levels.
        *   Keep prey populations under control.
        *   Maintain species diversity in a community by reducing the intensity of competition among competing prey species.
    *   **Adaptations in Prey to avoid Predation:**
        *   **Camouflage (Cryptic coloration):** Blending with surroundings (e.g., stick insects, chameleons).
        *   **Mimicry:** Resembling another species that is dangerous or unpalatable (e.g., Monarch butterfly is unpalatable due to chemicals, Viceroy butterfly mimics it).
        *   **Chemical defenses:** Producing poisonous or unpalatable chemicals (e.g., Monarch butterfly, certain plants like *Calotropis*).
        *   **Thorns and Spines:** In plants (e.g., *Acacia*, cactus).

4.  **Parasitism (+/-):**
    *   One species (parasite) lives on or in another species (host) and derives nourishment from it, harming the host in the process.
    *   **Types:**
        *   **Ectoparasites:** Live on the external surface of the host (e.g., lice on humans, ticks on dogs, Cuscuta on plants).
        *   **Endoparasites:** Live inside the host body (e.g., tapeworm, liver fluke, Plasmodium).
        *   **Brood Parasitism:** A special type of parasitism where the parasitic bird lays its eggs in the nest of another bird and lets the host bird incubate them (e.g., cuckoo and crow).
    *   **Adaptations in Parasites:** Loss of unnecessary sense organs, presence of adhesive organs/suckers, loss of digestive system, high reproductive capacity.

5.  **Commensalism (+/0):**
    *   One species benefits, and the other is neither harmed nor benefited.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   **Orchids growing on a mango branch:** Orchid gets support, mango tree is unaffected.
        *   **Barnacles on the back of a whale:** Barnacles get transport and food, whale is unaffected.
        *   **Cattle Egret and grazing cattle:** Egret feeds on insects disturbed by the cattle, cattle are unaffected.
        *   **Sea Anemone and Clownfish:** Clownfish gets protection from predators by living among the stinging tentacles of the anemone, anemone is unaffected.

6.  **Amensalism (-/0):**
    *   One species is harmed, and the other is unaffected.
    *   **Example:**
        *   **Penicillium and bacteria:** *Penicillium* secretes penicillin, which inhibits the growth of bacteria, but *Penicillium* itself is unaffected.
        *   **Black walnut tree and other plants:** Black walnut releases juglone, a chemical that inhibits the growth of other plants around it.
