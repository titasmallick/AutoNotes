## Section C: Short Answer Questions (2 marks each)

1.  Yeast acts as a leavening agent in bread making by fermenting sugars in the dough, producing carbon dioxide gas. This gas gets trapped in the gluten network, causing the dough to rise and giving bread its light texture. Two factors affecting its performance are **temperature** (optimal 25-30°C) and **sugar availability**.
2.  **Drying:** Removes moisture, extending shelf life significantly and concentrating flavor. Advantage: Lightweight, easy to store.
    **Freezing:** Preserves texture and flavor relatively well. Advantage: Retains more fresh qualities than drying, good for short to medium-term storage.
3.  Mushrooms are unique as they are a good source of **protein** (higher than most vegetables), **B vitamins**, and **Vitamin D** (when exposed to UV light), which is rare in plant-based foods. Compared to leafy greens, they offer a different profile, often with more umami flavor and a meatier texture.
4.  Fermentation in wine production is the conversion of grape sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide by yeast.
    **Key steps:**
    1.  **Yeast inoculation:** Selected yeast strains are added to grape must.
    2.  **Sugar conversion:** Yeast consumes sugars (glucose, fructose) and produces ethanol and CO2.
5.  Ideal conditions include controlled **temperature** (species-specific, often 15-25°C), high **humidity** (80-95%), adequate **ventilation** to control CO2 levels, and appropriate **light** (indirect, low intensity) for fruiting.
6.  Yeast produces alcohol and carbon dioxide through **anaerobic respiration** (fermentation). In the absence of oxygen, yeast breaks down glucose (sugar) into pyruvate, which is then converted into ethanol (alcohol) and carbon dioxide as byproducts.
7.  **Button mushroom:** Versatile, used in salads, soups, stir-fries.
    **Shiitake:** Meaty texture, umami flavor, popular in Asian cuisine, soups, stir-fries.
    **Oyster mushroom:** Delicate flavor, used in stir-fries, sautés, and as a meat substitute.
    **Portobello:** Large, meaty, often grilled or roasted as a burger substitute.
8.  Mushroom farming provides **employment opportunities** for rural communities, from cultivation to processing and marketing. It also offers a **source of income** for farmers, often utilizing agricultural waste as substrate, contributing to a circular economy and local food security.
9.  **Aerobic respiration** occurs in the presence of oxygen, where yeast completely breaks down glucose into carbon dioxide and water, yielding a large amount of energy.
    **Anaerobic fermentation** (or alcoholic fermentation) occurs in the absence of oxygen, where yeast converts glucose into ethanol and carbon dioxide, yielding less energy but producing alcohol.
10. Substrate preparation involves mixing raw materials (e.g., straw, sawdust, compost) and then treating them to eliminate competing microorganisms. This treatment can be **pasteurization** (partial sterilization, often with steam) or **sterilization** (complete elimination, usually by autoclaving).
11. Temperature significantly impacts yeast activity. Higher temperatures (within optimal range) generally increase fermentation rate, leading to faster sugar conversion. However, excessively high temperatures can stress yeast, produce off-flavors, or even kill the yeast. Lower temperatures slow down fermentation.
12. **Cap (Pileus):** The top part, protects the gills and aids in spore dispersal.
    **Gills (Lamellae):** Located under the cap, produce and release spores.
    **Stem (Stipe):** Supports the cap and elevates the gills for better spore dispersal.
    **Spores:** Reproductive cells, responsible for propagation.
13. Beer production involves malting, mashing, lautering, boiling, fermentation, and conditioning. Yeast's crucial role is during **fermentation**, where it converts sugars (from malted grains) in the wort into alcohol and carbon dioxide, transforming the sugary liquid into beer.
14. **Bag Cultivation:** Substrate is packed into plastic bags, sterilized, and inoculated. Advantage: High yield in controlled environments, easy to manage.
    **Log Cultivation:** Mushroom spawn is inoculated into hardwood logs. Advantage: More natural, produces high-quality mushrooms, long-term production (several years).
15. Factors include **temperature** (lower temperatures extend shelf life), **humidity** (too low causes drying, too high promotes spoilage), **packaging** (breathable packaging is crucial), and **harvesting maturity** (younger mushrooms generally last longer).
16. pH control is vital because yeast has an optimal pH range (slightly acidic, 4-6) for its metabolic activities. Deviations can inhibit yeast growth, slow fermentation, or lead to the production of undesirable byproducts and off-flavors.
17. **Harvesting:** Mushrooms are typically picked by hand when they reach desired maturity, often before the cap fully opens.
    **Post-harvest handling:** Involves cleaning (brushing off substrate), sorting by size and quality, packaging (often in breathable containers), and rapid cooling to extend shelf life.
18. Mushrooms are low in calories and fat, good source of **protein**, **dietary fiber**, and **B vitamins** (riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid). They also contain minerals like selenium, copper, and potassium, and can provide **Vitamin D** when exposed to UV light.
19. Wine aging involves storing wine in bottles or barrels for extended periods. During aging, complex chemical reactions occur, leading to the development of more nuanced **flavors and aromas**, softening of tannins, and improved mouthfeel. It can enhance the wine's complexity and overall quality.
20. **Steam Pasteurization:** Heating substrate with steam (e.g., 60-80°C for several hours) to kill most harmful microbes while leaving some beneficial ones.
    **Autoclaving/Sterilization:** Heating substrate under high pressure and temperature (e.g., 121°C for 1-2 hours) to kill all microorganisms, creating a sterile environment.
21. Enzymes are biological catalysts produced by yeast that facilitate the biochemical reactions of fermentation. For example, **invertase** breaks down sucrose into glucose and fructose, and **zymase complex** converts these sugars into ethanol and carbon dioxide.
22. **Contamination:** (e.g., green mold) Solution: Strict hygiene, proper sterilization of substrate.
    **Low yield:** Solution: Optimize environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, CO2), ensure quality spawn.
    **Pests:** (e.g., mites, flies) Solution: Integrated pest management, sanitation, physical barriers.
23. Quality parameters include **size** (uniformity), **color** (absence of discoloration), **firmness** (not soft or slimy), **absence of blemishes** (spots, bruises), and **cap condition** (e.g., closed cap for button mushrooms).
24. Distillation is a process used to concentrate alcohol from fermented beverages (like wine or beer) to produce spirits. It involves heating the fermented liquid, causing alcohol (which has a lower boiling point than water) to vaporize. The alcohol vapor is then cooled and condensed back into a liquid, resulting in a higher alcohol concentration.
25. Fresh mushrooms require **breathable packaging** (e.g., paper bags, perforated plastic punnets) to allow for gas exchange and prevent moisture buildup, which can lead to spoilage. They should be stored in a **refrigerator** at low temperatures (0-4°C) to slow down respiration and microbial growth.
26. Yeast strain selection involves choosing specific yeast varieties based on their desired characteristics for a particular application. For example, **baker's yeast** is selected for high CO2 production, while **brewer's yeast** is chosen for specific flavor profiles and alcohol tolerance in beer, and **wine yeast** for efficient sugar conversion and tolerance to higher alcohol levels.
27. Dried mushrooms, mushroom powder, mushroom extracts (for medicinal or culinary use), canned mushrooms, pickled mushrooms, mushroom snacks, and mushroom-based meat substitutes.
28. Mushroom cultivation offers several environmental benefits, including **waste management** by utilizing agricultural and industrial byproducts (e.g., straw, sawdust) as substrate, reducing landfill waste. It also has a **low water footprint** compared to traditional agriculture and can contribute to **carbon sequestration**.
29. Mushroom spawn production involves growing mushroom mycelium (the vegetative part of the fungus) on a sterile grain or other substrate. A pure culture of the desired mushroom species is inoculated onto the sterilized grain, which is then incubated until fully colonized by the mycelium. This colonized grain is the "spawn" used to inoculate larger substrates for mushroom cultivation.
30. Carbon dioxide plays a critical role in mushroom cultivation, particularly during the fruiting stage. High CO2 levels inhibit the formation of fruiting bodies, promoting vegetative growth (mycelium). Lowering CO2 levels (through ventilation) triggers the initiation of mushroom pins and promotes healthy fruiting body development.
31. **Wild mushrooms** grow naturally in their native habitats and are foraged. They often have unique flavors and textures but can be difficult to identify (some are poisonous) and their availability is seasonal.
    **Cultivated mushrooms** are grown in controlled environments. They offer consistent supply, standardized quality, and are safe to consume, but may lack the intensity of flavor found in some wild varieties.
32. Global mushroom consumption is increasing due to growing awareness of their nutritional and health benefits, rising demand for plant-based protein sources, and increasing popularity of diverse cuisines. There's a trend towards specialty mushrooms and value-added mushroom products.
33. Yeast propagation for commercial use involves culturing a small amount of pure yeast strain in a nutrient-rich medium under controlled conditions (temperature, aeration) to increase its biomass. This process ensures a sufficient quantity of healthy, active yeast cells for large-scale fermentation processes in industries like baking, brewing, or winemaking.
34. Safety measures include maintaining **strict hygiene** to prevent contamination, ensuring **proper ventilation** to manage CO2 levels and prevent respiratory issues, using **personal protective equipment** (e.g., masks, gloves) when handling substrate or chemicals, and ensuring **structural integrity** of growing facilities.
35. **Drying:** Mushrooms are dehydrated using hot air or freeze-drying to remove moisture, extending shelf life.
    **Canning:** Mushrooms are blanched, packed in brine, and heat-processed in sealed cans to achieve commercial sterility.
    **Freezing:** Mushrooms are blanched and then rapidly frozen to preserve texture and flavor.
36. Factors affecting alcohol content include the **initial sugar concentration** of the raw material (more sugar, more alcohol), the **yeast strain's alcohol tolerance**, **fermentation temperature** (optimal range for yeast activity), and **fermentation time** (longer fermentation can lead to higher alcohol).
37. Oyster mushroom cultivation typically involves:
    1.  **Substrate preparation:** Pasteurizing or sterilizing a lignocellulosic substrate (e.g., straw, sawdust).
    2.  **Inoculation:** Mixing the substrate with oyster mushroom spawn.
    3.  **Incubation (Spawn Run):** Mycelium colonizes the substrate in a dark, warm environment.
    4.  **Fruiting:** Exposing colonized substrate to light, fresh air, and high humidity to induce pinning and fruiting body development.
    5.  **Harvesting:** Picking mature mushrooms.
38. Sanitation is crucial in yeast fermentation to prevent contamination by undesirable microorganisms (e.g., wild yeasts, bacteria) that can produce off-flavors, spoil the product, or inhibit the desired yeast. Proper cleaning and sanitizing of equipment and fermentation vessels ensure a clean environment for the selected yeast strain to thrive.
39. Basic equipment includes: substrate mixing tools, sterilization equipment (e.g., pressure cooker or steam generator), inoculation tools, growing bags or containers, humidity and temperature control devices (e.g., humidifier, heater), and ventilation fans.
40. **Clarification:** Involves removing suspended particles from wine to make it clear. This can be done through **fining** (adding agents that bind to particles, causing them to settle) or **racking** (siphoning wine off the settled lees).
    **Filtration:** Passing wine through a filter medium to remove remaining suspended particles, ensuring a brilliant clarity.
41. While all edible mushrooms share general nutritional benefits (low calorie, good protein, fiber), specific compositions vary. For example, **Shiitake** are known for their immune-boosting compounds, **Oyster mushrooms** for higher protein, and **Button mushrooms** for their versatility and common availability. Vitamin D content can vary based on UV exposure.
42. Challenges include maintaining **cold chain logistics** to preserve freshness, meeting **international quality standards** and phytosanitary regulations, dealing with **customs procedures** and tariffs, and managing **market fluctuations** and competition from other producing countries.
43. Yeast recovery involves collecting yeast cells that have settled at the bottom of fermentation vessels after primary fermentation. This yeast can then be "cropped" and re-pitched into new batches of wort for subsequent fermentations. Reuse helps maintain consistent beer quality, reduces costs, and ensures a healthy yeast population.
44. Organic methods involve using **certified organic substrates**, avoiding synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, using **natural pest control** methods (e.g., beneficial insects), and relying on **composting** and natural nutrient cycling.
45. Moisture control is crucial throughout mushroom cultivation. The substrate needs optimal moisture for mycelial growth. During fruiting, high humidity is essential to prevent the mushrooms from drying out and to promote proper cap and stem development. Misting and humidifiers are used to maintain ideal moisture levels.
46. Alcohol testing in fermented products involves measuring the alcohol content (ABV). Common methods include using a **hydrometer** to measure specific gravity before and after fermentation (alcohol is less dense than water), or more precise laboratory methods like **gas chromatography** or **enzymatic assays**.
47. While many cultivated mushrooms are grown indoors year-round, some outdoor cultivation methods (e.g., log cultivation of shiitake) are seasonal, depending on climate and natural fruiting cycles. Indoor cultivation aims to mimic ideal seasonal conditions consistently.
48. Ventilation is vital in mushroom growing houses to control **carbon dioxide levels** (high CO2 inhibits fruiting), regulate **temperature**, manage **humidity**, and provide **fresh air** for mushroom development. Proper air exchange prevents the buildup of harmful gases and promotes healthy growth.
49. Research developments include:
    *   **Automated environmental control systems** (IoT sensors for temperature, humidity, CO2).
    *   **Vertical farming techniques** for maximizing space utilization.
    *   **New substrate formulations** from diverse agricultural wastes.
    *   **Strain improvement** through genetic selection for higher yields or specific traits.
50. Fungi have promising future prospects in food biotechnology, including:
    *   **Alternative protein sources:** Mycoprotein (fungal protein) as a sustainable meat alternative.
    *   **Enzyme production:** Fungal enzymes for food processing (e.g., baking, brewing).
    *   **Bioactive compounds:** Extraction of health-promoting compounds for functional foods.
    *   **Waste valorization:** Converting agricultural waste into valuable food products.

## Section D: Long Answer Questions (3 marks each)

1.  Mushroom cultivation begins with **substrate preparation**, where agricultural waste (e.g., straw, sawdust) is mixed and treated (pasteurized or sterilized) to eliminate contaminants. Next, **inoculation** occurs, where mushroom spawn (mycelium on grain) is introduced to the cooled substrate. The **spawn run** phase follows, where mycelium colonizes the substrate in a dark, warm environment. After full colonization, the substrate is moved to a **fruiting chamber** where environmental factors are precisely controlled: **temperature** (species-specific), high **humidity** (80-95%), and reduced **CO2 levels** (via ventilation) to induce pinning. Adequate **fresh air exchange** is crucial. **Light** (indirect) is also provided to guide fruiting body development. Finally, **harvesting** is done by hand when mushrooms reach optimal maturity, often before the cap fully opens, to ensure quality. **Quality control** involves monitoring environmental parameters, inspecting for contamination, and grading harvested mushrooms by size, color, and firmness.
2.  Alcoholic fermentation by yeast is an anaerobic biochemical process where glucose (sugar) is converted into ethanol (alcohol) and carbon dioxide. The process starts with **glycolysis**, where glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate, producing a small amount of ATP. In the absence of oxygen, pyruvate is then decarboxylated to acetaldehyde, which is subsequently reduced to ethanol, regenerating NAD+ for glycolysis to continue.
    **Factors influencing fermentation rate and product quality:**
    1.  **Temperature:** Optimal temperature range (e.g., 20-30°C for most yeasts) maximizes enzyme activity. Too low, fermentation slows; too high, yeast stress, off-flavors, or death.
    2.  **Sugar Concentration:** Sufficient sugar is needed for fermentation. Very high concentrations can inhibit yeast.
    3.  **Yeast Strain:** Different strains have varying alcohol tolerance, flavor profiles, and fermentation kinetics.
    4.  **pH:** Yeast thrives in slightly acidic conditions (pH 4-6). Deviations can inhibit activity.
    5.  **Nutrients:** Availability of nitrogen, vitamins, and minerals is crucial for healthy yeast growth and fermentation.
    6.  **Oxygen (initial):** A small amount of oxygen at the start is beneficial for yeast growth and sterol synthesis, but fermentation itself is anaerobic.
3.  **Button Mushroom (Agaricus bisporus):**
    *   **Method:** Primarily cultivated on pasteurized compost (often horse manure-based) in controlled indoor environments (trays or beds).
    *   **Requirements:** Specific casing layer (peat/limestone mix) for fruiting, precise temperature (16-18°C) and humidity (90-95%) control, and strict CO2 management.
    *   **Market Value:** High volume, widely consumed, relatively low price due to efficient production.
    **Oyster Mushroom (Pleurotus spp.):**
    *   **Method:** Versatile, grown on various lignocellulosic substrates (straw, sawdust, agricultural waste) in bags or bottles, often pasteurized.
    *   **Requirements:** Less stringent environmental control than button mushrooms, good ventilation, moderate temperature (18-24°C), high humidity (85-90%).
    *   **Market Value:** Moderate volume, popular specialty mushroom, higher price than button mushrooms.
    **Shiitake Mushroom (Lentinula edodes):**
    *   **Method:** Traditionally grown on hardwood logs outdoors; commercially on sterilized sawdust blocks indoors.
    *   **Requirements:** Long incubation period (months on logs), specific temperature shocking (cold water immersion) to induce fruiting on logs, precise humidity and air exchange for indoor blocks.
    *   **Market Value:** High value specialty mushroom, prized for umami flavor and medicinal properties, higher price than oyster mushrooms.
    **Contrast:** Button mushrooms require complex compost and casing, while oyster and shiitake can use simpler lignocellulosic waste. Button mushrooms are typically grown in large, highly controlled facilities, while oyster and shiitake can be cultivated on a smaller scale with less intensive environmental control (especially logs). Market value generally reflects cultivation complexity and demand for specialty traits.
4.  **Grape Selection & Harvesting:** Grapes are chosen based on ripeness, sugar content, and varietal characteristics. Yeast's role is indirect here; healthy grapes provide the ideal sugar source for future fermentation.
    **Crushing & Destemming:** Grapes are crushed to release juice (must). For red wines, skins are kept for color/tannins. Yeast is naturally present on grape skins (wild yeast), but often commercial yeast is added.
    **Pressing (for white wine):** Juice is separated from solids. For red wine, pressing occurs after fermentation.
    **Fermentation:** This is where yeast plays its central role. **Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)** converts grape sugars (glucose, fructose) into ethanol and carbon dioxide.
