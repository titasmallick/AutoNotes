## Section C: Short Answer Questions

1.  Biotic and abiotic factors are in constant interaction. For example, plants (biotic) use sunlight (abiotic) for photosynthesis, and the type of soil (abiotic) determines which plants can grow, which in turn affects the animals (biotic) that live there.
2.  Producers, like plants, are the foundation of ecosystems. They convert light energy into chemical energy through photosynthesis, providing the energy source for all other organisms in the ecosystem.
3.  Primary consumers are herbivores that feed on producers, like a deer eating grass. Secondary consumers are carnivores or omnivores that feed on primary consumers, like a wolf eating a deer.
4.  Decomposers, such as bacteria and fungi, are crucial because they break down dead organic material. This process recycles nutrients back into the ecosystem, making them available for producers.
5.  A food chain is a linear sequence of organisms where nutrients and energy are transferred from one organism to another. A food web is a more complex network of interconnected food chains, providing a more realistic view of the feeding relationships in an ecosystem.
6.  Energy flows from the sun to producers, then to primary consumers, then to secondary and tertiary consumers. At each trophic level, a significant amount of energy is lost as heat, which is why energy flow is unidirectional and non-cyclical.
7.  Interdependence means that species in an ecosystem rely on each other for survival. For example, bees depend on flowers for nectar, and flowers depend on bees for pollination.
8.  Symbiotic relationships, such as mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism, are important because they can lead to coevolution and increase the biodiversity of an ecosystem. They are a major driving force of evolution.
9.  In parasitism, the parasite benefits at the expense of the host, but the host is usually not killed. In predation, the predator kills and consumes the prey.
10. Climatic factors like temperature, rainfall, and sunlight determine the types of plants that can grow in a region. This, in turn, dictates the types of animals and other organisms that can survive there, thus shaping the entire ecosystem.
11. Soil provides essential nutrients, water, and anchorage for plants, which are the primary producers in most terrestrial ecosystems. It also hosts a vast community of microorganisms that are vital for nutrient cycling.
12. Water is essential for all life forms as it is a universal solvent, a major component of cells, and is required for metabolic processes like photosynthesis and respiration.
13. Temperature variations affect the metabolic rates, growth, and behavior of organisms. Extreme temperatures can limit the distribution of species and the overall productivity of an ecosystem.
14. Wind contributes to seed dispersal, pollination of plants, and can influence the distribution of organisms. It also affects the rate of evaporation and transpiration, influencing water availability.
15. In a forest ecosystem, the flora (plants) provide food and shelter for the fauna (animals). The fauna, in turn, help in pollination and seed dispersal for the flora.
16. Carrying capacity is the maximum number of individuals of a species that an ecosystem can sustainably support. It is important because it highlights the limits of an ecosystem and the consequences of overpopulation.
17. Human activities such as pollution, deforestation, and urbanization can destroy habitats, reduce biodiversity, and disrupt the balance of ecosystems.
18. Ecological succession is the gradual process by which ecosystems change and develop over time. It begins with pioneer species and progresses towards a stable climax community, increasing biodiversity and complexity.
19. Pioneer species are the first to colonize barren environments. They are hardy species that can withstand harsh conditions and through their life processes, they modify the environment, making it more suitable for other species to follow.
20. Biodiversity increases the stability and resilience of an ecosystem. A diverse ecosystem is more likely to withstand and recover from disturbances like disease or climate change.
21. Competition for limited resources like food, water, and territory shapes the structure of an ecosystem by influencing the distribution, abundance, and evolution of species.
22. Ecological niche partitioning is the process by which competing species use the environment differently in a way that helps them to coexist. For example, different bird species may feed on insects in different parts of the same tree.
23. Habitat fragmentation breaks up large, continuous habitats into smaller, isolated patches. This can lead to reduced genetic diversity, increased vulnerability to extinction, and altered species interactions.
24. Invasive species are non-native species that can cause significant harm to the native ecosystem by outcompeting native species for resources, preying on them, or introducing diseases.
25. The greenhouse effect is the warming of the Earth's surface due to the trapping of heat by greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. This can lead to climate change, which disrupts ecosystems by altering temperature and weather patterns.
26. Deforestation, the clearing of forests, leads to loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and disruption of water cycles. It also contributes to climate change by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed from the atmosphere.
27. Wetlands are ecologically important because they act as natural water purifiers, provide flood control, and serve as critical habitats for a wide variety of plants and animals.
28. Marine ecosystems are threatened by overfishing, pollution (including plastics and chemical runoff), ocean acidification, and rising sea temperatures due to climate change.
29. Migration allows animals to move between different habitats to find food, escape harsh weather, or reproduce. This movement is crucial for maintaining genetic diversity and connecting different populations within an ecosystem.
30. Organisms adapt to seasonal changes through various strategies. For example, some animals hibernate during winter to conserve energy, while others migrate to warmer regions. Many plants become dormant during cold or dry seasons.
31. Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create their own food in the form of glucose. It is ecologically significant because it is the primary source of energy for most of the Earth's ecosystems.
32. The water cycle, which includes evaporation, condensation, and precipitation, is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. It is vital for all ecosystems as it distributes water, which is essential for life.
33. Pollination, the transfer of pollen from a male part of a plant to a female part, is crucial for the reproduction of most flowering plants. This process ensures the production of seeds and fruits, which are a food source for many animals.
34. Seed dispersal, the movement or transport of seeds away from the parent plant, is important for plants to colonize new areas. This reduces competition with the parent plant and increases the genetic diversity of the population.
35. Mutualistic relationships are a form of symbiosis where both participating species benefit. For example, bees get nectar from flowers, and in return, they pollinate the flowers. These relationships can be crucial for the survival of the involved species.
36. Acid rain, caused by pollutants like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, can severely damage forest ecosystems. It leaches essential nutrients from the soil, harms the leaves of trees, and makes them more susceptible to disease and pests.
37. Eutrophication is the enrichment of water bodies with nutrients, often from agricultural runoff. This leads to excessive growth of algae (algal blooms), which depletes the water of oxygen when they die and decompose, killing fish and other aquatic life.
38. Indicator species are organisms whose presence, absence, or abundance reflects a specific environmental condition. They can be used as an early warning system to monitor the health of an ecosystem and detect environmental changes.
39. Ecological resilience is the ability of an ecosystem to resist or recover from disturbances while maintaining its basic functions and structure. High resilience is crucial for the long-term survival of ecosystems in a changing world.
40. r-selected species, like mice, produce many offspring with little parental care, and thrive in unstable environments. K-selected species, like elephants, produce few offspring with high parental care, and are adapted to stable environments near the carrying capacity.
41. Biogeochemical cycles, such as the carbon and nitrogen cycles, are the pathways by which essential elements are circulated through the Earth's biotic and abiotic components. These cycles are vital for sustaining life as they make essential nutrients available to organisms.
42. Primary productivity is the rate at which energy is converted into organic substances by producers (e.g., plants) through photosynthesis. It forms the base of the food web and determines the total energy available in an ecosystem.
43. The 10% rule states that only about 10% of the energy from one trophic level is transferred to the next. This limits the number of trophic levels in a food chain and explains why there are fewer organisms at higher trophic levels.
44. Detritus, which is dead organic matter, is a crucial part of nutrient cycling in ecosystems. Decomposers break down detritus, releasing essential nutrients back into the soil and water, where they can be used by producers.
45. Coevolution is the process where two or more species reciprocally affect each other's evolution. For example, a predator and its prey may coevolve, with the predator developing better hunting skills and the prey developing better defense mechanisms.
46. Genetic diversity, the variety of genes within a species, is crucial for the ability of a population to adapt to changing environmental conditions. A population with high genetic diversity is more likely to have individuals with traits that allow them to survive and reproduce in a new environment.
47. A metapopulation is a group of spatially separated populations of the same species which interact at some level. This concept is important in conservation because it highlights the importance of maintaining connectivity between fragmented habitats to ensure the long-term survival of a species.
48. Corridors are strips of habitat that connect otherwise isolated patches of habitat. They are important in wildlife conservation because they allow animals to move between patches, which can increase genetic diversity and help maintain viable populations.
49. Ecosystem services are the many benefits that humans receive from nature, such as clean air and water, pollination of crops, and regulation of climate. These services are essential for human well-being and the economy.
50. The health of ecosystems is directly linked to human well-being. Healthy ecosystems provide essential services like clean water, food, and medicine. Degradation of ecosystems can lead to loss of these services, increased risk of disease, and social and economic instability.

## Section D: Long Answer Questions

1.  An ecosystem consists of biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) components that interact with each other. Biotic components include producers (plants), consumers (animals), and decomposers (bacteria and fungi). Abiotic components include sunlight, water, soil, and temperature. The functioning of an ecosystem involves energy flow and nutrient cycling. Energy flows from the sun to producers, then to consumers, and is lost at each trophic level. Nutrients are cycled between the biotic and abiotic components, for example, when decomposers break down dead organisms and return nutrients to the soil.

2.  The three main types of biotic components in an ecosystem are producers, consumers, and decomposers. Producers, such as plants, are autotrophs that produce their own food through photosynthesis, forming the base of the food web. Consumers are heterotrophs that obtain energy by feeding on other organisms; they can be primary (herbivores), secondary (carnivores), or tertiary (top carnivores). Decomposers, like bacteria and fungi, break down dead organic matter, recycling nutrients back into the ecosystem, which is essential for its continued productivity.

3.  Energy flow in an ecosystem is a one-way process. It begins with solar energy, which is captured by producers (plants) through photosynthesis and converted into chemical energy. This energy is then transferred to primary consumers (herbivores) when they eat the plants, and then to secondary and tertiary consumers (carnivores) when they eat other animals. At each trophic level, a significant amount of energy is lost as heat during metabolic processes, which is why the amount of available energy decreases at successively higher trophic levels. Decomposers obtain energy by breaking down dead organisms from all trophic levels.

4.  Food chains, food webs, and ecological pyramids are all models used to understand energy and nutrient flow in ecosystems. A food chain is a simple, linear sequence of who eats whom. A food web is a more complex and realistic model that shows the interconnectedness of multiple food chains. Ecological pyramids are graphical representations of the number of individuals, biomass, or energy at each trophic level. Pyramids of numbers and biomass can sometimes be inverted, but pyramids of energy are always upright, illustrating the loss of energy at each successive trophic level.

5.  Symbiotic relationships are close, long-term interactions between two different species. There are three main types: mutualism, where both species benefit (e.g., bees and flowers); commensalism, where one species benefits and the other is unaffected (e.g., barnacles on a whale); and parasitism, where one species (the parasite) benefits at the expense of the other (the host) (e.g., a tapeworm in a human). These interactions are a major driving force of evolution and contribute to the biodiversity of ecosystems.

6.  Ecological succession is the process of change in the species structure of an ecological community over time. It starts with pioneer species colonizing a new or disturbed environment. These species modify the environment, making it suitable for other species to establish. Over time, this leads to a more complex and stable climax community. Factors that influence succession include climate, soil type, and the frequency of disturbances.

7.  Major abiotic factors influencing ecosystems include sunlight, water, temperature, and soil composition. Sunlight is the primary energy source for most ecosystems. Water is essential for all life. Temperature affects metabolic rates and the geographic distribution of species. Soil provides nutrients and a substrate for plants, forming the foundation of terrestrial ecosystems. The specific characteristics of these abiotic factors determine the types of organisms that can survive in a particular ecosystem.

8.  Biodiversity, or the variety of life, is crucial for ecosystem stability. A diverse ecosystem is more resilient to disturbances like climate change or disease. Major threats to biodiversity today include habitat loss and fragmentation due to human activities like agriculture and urbanization, pollution, climate change, and the introduction of invasive species.

9.  An ecological niche is the specific role a species plays in its ecosystem, including its habitat, diet, and interactions with other species. Niche partitioning is a process where competing species evolve to use different resources or parts of the habitat to reduce competition. For example, different species of warblers may feed on insects in different parts of the same tree, allowing them to coexist.

10. Nutrient cycling is the movement of essential elements like carbon and nitrogen through the biotic and abiotic components of an ecosystem. The carbon cycle involves the exchange of carbon between the atmosphere, oceans, and living organisms through processes like photosynthesis and respiration. The nitrogen cycle involves the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form by nitrogen-fixing bacteria, its uptake by plants, and its return to the atmosphere through denitrification. These cycles are essential for sustaining life.

11. Human activities like pollution, deforestation, and overfishing have a significant negative impact on natural ecosystems, leading to loss of biodiversity and disruption of ecosystem services. To conserve ecosystems, we can take measures such as establishing protected areas, promoting sustainable resource management, reducing pollution, and restoring degraded habitats. Public awareness and education are also crucial for fostering a conservation ethic.

12. Carrying capacity is the maximum population size of a species that an environment can sustain indefinitely. It is determined by limiting factors such as the availability of food, water, and space. When a population exceeds the carrying capacity, it can lead to a decline in the population due to resource scarcity and increased competition. Understanding carrying capacity is crucial for managing wildlife populations and human populations.

13. Forest ecosystems are characterized by a high density of trees. They have a complex vertical structure with different layers, such as the canopy, understory, and forest floor, which provide a variety of habitats for a diverse range of flora and fauna. Ecologically, forests are vital for regulating climate, conserving soil and water, and storing a large amount of carbon.

14. Aquatic ecosystems, including freshwater and marine environments, are threatened by pollution from agricultural runoff and industrial discharge, overfishing, habitat destruction (e.g., of coral reefs and mangroves), and the impacts of climate change like ocean acidification and warming. Conservation measures include reducing pollution, establishing marine protected areas, practicing sustainable fishing, and mitigating climate change.

15. Decomposers, such as bacteria and fungi, play a vital role in ecosystem functioning by breaking down dead organic matter. This process, called decomposition, releases essential nutrients like carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus back into the soil and water, making them available for producers to use. Without decomposers, nutrients would be locked up in dead organisms, and the ecosystem would cease to function.

16. Ecological resilience is the capacity of an ecosystem to withstand disturbances and maintain its basic functions and structure. An ecosystem with high resilience can absorb shocks and recover quickly. For example, a forest might recover from a fire over time through the process of ecological succession. Resilience is a key attribute for the long-term persistence of ecosystems in a changing world.

17. Primary succession occurs in an environment devoid of vegetation and usually lacking topsoil, such as a newly formed volcanic island. Secondary succession occurs in an area that previously supported life but has undergone a disturbance, such as a fire or logging, that has not eliminated all life and nutrients from the environment. Secondary succession is generally faster because the soil is already present.

18. Keystone species are species that have a disproportionately large effect on their environment relative to their abundance. They play a critical role in maintaining the structure of an ecological community. For example, sea otters are a keystone species in kelp forests because they prey on sea urchins, which would otherwise overgraze the kelp and destroy the habitat.

19. Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll pigment. During photosynthesis in green plants, light energy is captured and used to convert water, carbon dioxide, and minerals into oxygen and energy-rich organic compounds. It is the foundation of energy flow in most ecosystems, providing the energy that sustains all other trophic levels.

20. The water cycle, or hydrologic cycle, is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. It involves processes like evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. The water cycle is crucial for both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems as it distributes water, a vital resource for all living organisms, across the planet.

21. Organisms have evolved a wide range of adaptations to survive in different ecosystems. For example, desert plants have deep roots and succulent leaves to conserve water, while animals in cold climates have thick fur for insulation. Camouflage, mimicry, and specialized beaks are other examples of adaptations that help organisms to feed, avoid predation, and reproduce successfully in their specific environments.

22. Biological magnification, or biomagnification, is the increasing concentration of toxic substances in organisms at successively higher levels in a food chain. For example, a pesticide might be present in low concentrations in water, but it becomes more concentrated in the fish that drink the water, and even more concentrated in the birds that eat the fish. This can lead to serious health problems and even death in top predators.

23. The greenhouse effect is the natural process that warms the Earth's surface. When the Sun's energy reaches the Earth’s atmosphere, some of it is reflected back to space and the rest is absorbed and re-radiated by greenhouse gases. An enhanced greenhouse effect, due to increased emissions of gases like carbon dioxide from human activities, is causing global warming and climate change, which in turn impacts ecosystems worldwide.

24. Eutrophication is the enrichment of an ecosystem with chemical nutrients, typically compounds containing nitrogen, phosphorus, or both. It can be a natural process in lakes, but is often accelerated by human activities. The excess nutrients lead to a dense growth of plant life and death of animal life from lack of oxygen, which has severe negative effects on aquatic ecosystems.

25. Pollination, the transfer of pollen, is essential for the sexual reproduction of most flowering plants. Seed dispersal, the movement of seeds away from the parent plant, is crucial for the colonization of new habitats and for reducing competition. Both processes are vital for maintaining plant populations and the genetic diversity of ecosystems. Many animals play a key role as pollinators and seed dispersers.

26. Migration is the seasonal movement of animals from one region to another. It is a key survival strategy for many species, allowing them to find food, escape harsh weather, and access suitable breeding grounds. Migration also plays an important role in ecosystem dynamics by connecting different habitats and influencing predator-prey interactions.

27. Coevolution is the process where two or more species reciprocally affect each other's evolution. This is often seen in predator-prey relationships, where the prey evolves better defenses and the predator evolves better hunting strategies. Another example is the relationship between flowering plants and their pollinators, where the flower and the pollinator have evolved to be mutually adapted.

28. Genetic diversity is the total number of genetic characteristics in the genetic makeup of a species. It is important because it allows populations to adapt to changing environments. Threats to genetic diversity include habitat loss, population fragmentation, and genetic drift in small populations. Low genetic diversity can make a species more vulnerable to extinction.

29. A metapopulation is a group of spatially separated populations of the same species that interact at some level. The concept is important in conservation biology because it recognizes that even small, isolated populations can be crucial for the long-term survival of a species, as they can be a source of individuals to recolonize other patches.

30. Ecosystem services are the many and varied benefits that humans freely gain from the natural environment and from properly-functioning ecosystems. These include provisioning services like food and water; regulating services like climate regulation and flood control; cultural services like recreational and spiritual benefits; and supporting services like nutrient cycling. The economic value of these services is immense, though often not fully appreciated.

31. Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It is important for ecosystem conservation because it seeks to balance economic and social development with environmental protection. This approach recognizes that a healthy environment is the foundation for a healthy society and economy.

32. Conservation biology is a scientific discipline that focuses on protecting and restoring biodiversity and preventing the extinction of species. It uses principles from ecology, genetics, and other fields to develop strategies for managing and protecting species and their habitats. This includes establishing protected areas, managing endangered species populations, and restoring degraded ecosystems.

33. Invasive species are non-native species that can cause significant harm to the native ecosystem. They can outcompete native species for resources, prey on them, or introduce diseases. Methods for controlling invasive species include biological control (using natural enemies), chemical control (using pesticides), and mechanical control (physically removing them).

34. The ecological footprint is a measure of human demand on the Earth's ecosystems. It represents the amount of biologically productive land and water area required to produce the resources an individual, population, or activity consumes and to absorb the waste they generate. Reducing our ecological footprint through sustainable practices is essential for the long-term health of the planet.

35. Wetland ecosystems, such as marshes, swamps, and bogs, are areas where water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year. They are incredibly important for biodiversity, water filtration, flood control, and carbon storage. Their unique hydrology and vegetation support a wide array of specialized flora and fauna.

36. Coral reef ecosystems are highly diverse underwater ecosystems held together by calcium carbonate structures secreted by corals. They are threatened by a number of factors, including climate change (which causes coral bleaching), ocean acidification, pollution, and destructive fishing practices. Conservation efforts include creating marine protected areas, reducing pollution, and addressing climate change.

37. Habitat fragmentation is the process by which a large, continuous area of habitat is both reduced in area and divided into two or more fragments. This can lead to a decrease in biodiversity, as smaller fragments can only support smaller populations, which are more vulnerable to extinction. It also creates more "edge habitat," which can negatively affect species that are adapted to the interior of the habitat.

38. Apex predators are predators at the top of a food chain, without natural predators of their own. They play a crucial role in maintaining the health and balance of their ecosystems by regulating the populations of their prey. This can have cascading effects throughout the food web, a phenomenon known as a trophic cascade.

39. Soil is a vital component of terrestrial ecosystems. It provides a medium for plant growth, a habitat for a diverse range of organisms, and plays a key role in nutrient cycling and water filtration. Soil health is affected by factors such as organic matter content, pH, and the presence of pollutants. Sustainable agricultural practices are essential for maintaining soil health.

40. Limiting factors are environmental factors that restrict the size, abundance, or distribution of a population. These can be biotic, like the availability of food, or abiotic, like temperature or water availability. The concept of limiting factors is closely tied to the concept of carrying capacity, as these factors determine the maximum population size an ecosystem can support.

41. Ecological pyramids are graphical representations of the trophic structure of ecosystems. A pyramid of numbers shows the total number of individual organisms at each trophic level. A pyramid of biomass represents the total mass of living organic matter at each level. A pyramid of energy shows the total amount of energy at each level. While pyramids of numbers and biomass can sometimes be inverted, pyramids of energy are always upright.

42. Primary productivity is the rate at which energy is converted by photosynthetic and chemosynthetic autotrophs to organic substances. It is the base of the food web. Secondary productivity is the rate at which consumers convert the chemical energy of their food into their own biomass. It represents the energy flow through the higher trophic levels of the ecosystem.

43. Pioneer species are the first species to colonize a barren or disturbed environment in the process of ecological succession. They are typically hardy species with adaptations such as tolerance to extreme conditions, rapid growth, and the ability to fix nitrogen. Examples include lichens and mosses on bare rock. They play a crucial role in creating soil and modifying the environment, paving the way for other species to establish.

44. Biological control is a method of controlling pests such as insects, mites, weeds and plant diseases using other organisms. It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory, or other natural mechanisms to control pest populations. An advantage of biological control over chemical pesticides is that it is more environmentally friendly and can be self-sustaining.

45. Climate change is having a profound impact on ecosystems worldwide. Rising temperatures are causing shifts in the geographic ranges of many species, as they move towards the poles or to higher altitudes to find suitable climates. Changes in precipitation patterns are affecting water availability, and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense, disrupting ecosystems and threatening species survival.

46. Edge effects are the changes in population or community structures that occur at the boundary of two habitats. As habitats become more fragmented, the amount of edge habitat increases. This can be detrimental to species that are adapted to the interior of a habitat, as they may be more vulnerable to predation or competition from species that thrive in edge environments.

47. Indicator species are species whose presence, absence, or abundance reflects a specific environmental condition. They can be used to monitor the health of an ecosystem. For example, the presence of certain types of lichens can indicate good air quality, while their absence can signal pollution. They are a valuable tool for environmental assessment and management.

48. Corridors are strips of habitat that connect fragmented patches of habitat. They are important for conservation because they allow wildlife to move between patches, which can increase genetic diversity, provide access to more resources, and help populations to persist in fragmented landscapes. They are a key strategy for mitigating the negative effects of habitat fragmentation.

49. The minimum viable population (MVP) is the smallest size that a population can be and still have a high probability of persisting for a given period of time. It is a key concept in conservation biology used to estimate the number of individuals required for the long-term survival of a species. The MVP is influenced by factors such as genetics, demography, and environmental stochasticity.

50. The health of ecosystems is inextricably linked to human well-being. Healthy ecosystems provide us with essential services such as clean air and water, food, medicine, and protection from natural disasters. For example, forests help to regulate our climate and provide us with timber, while wetlands filter our water and protect us from floods. The degradation of ecosystems threatens these services and ultimately our own health and survival.
