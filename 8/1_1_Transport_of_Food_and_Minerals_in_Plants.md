# Transport of Food and Minerals in Plants

## Diffusion

**Definition:** The net movement of molecules or atoms from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration.

## Osmosis

**Definition:** The spontaneous net movement of solvent molecules through a selectively permeable membrane into a region of higher solute concentration, in the direction that tends to equalize the solute concentrations on the two sides.

*   **Example:** The absorption of water by plant roots.
*   **Semipermeable Membrane:** A membrane that allows certain molecules or ions to pass through it by diffusion and occasionally specialized "facilitated diffusion," along with other variations of active transport and passive transport.
*   **Root Pressure:** The transverse osmotic pressure within the cells of a root system that causes sap to rise through a plant stem to the leaves.

## Active Transport

**Definition:** The movement of ions or molecules across a cell membrane into a region of higher concentration, assisted by enzymes and requiring energy.
