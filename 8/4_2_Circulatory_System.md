## Internal Structure of the Heart

*   **Valves:** Flaps of tissue that prevent the backflow of blood.
*   **Septum:** A wall of muscle that separates the right and left sides of the heart.
*   **Pacemaker:** A small group of cells in the right atrium that controls the heart rate.

## Blood Vessels

*   **Aorta:** The largest artery in the body.
*   **Pulmonary Trunk:** The artery that carries deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs.
*   **Coronary Artery:** The artery that supplies blood to the heart muscle.
*   **Coronary Vein:** The vein that drains blood from the heart muscle.
*   **Vena Cava:** The largest vein in the body.

## Circulation of Blood

*   **Double Circulation:** A circulatory system in which the blood travels twice through the heart for each complete circuit of the body.

## Blood Groups

*   **A, B, AB, and O:** The four main blood groups.
*   **Universal Donor:** A person with blood group O, who can donate blood to a person with any other blood group.
*   **Universal Acceptor:** A person with blood group AB, who can receive blood from a person with any other blood group.

## Conditions Related to the Functioning of the Heart

*   **Palpitations:** A noticeably rapid, strong, or irregular heartbeat due to agitation, exertion, or illness.
*   **Cardiac Arrest:** A sudden, unexpected loss of heart function, breathing, and consciousness.
*   **Hypertension:** High blood pressure.
