## Plants

### Asexual Reproduction

*   **Binary Fission:** A method of asexual reproduction that involves the splitting of a parent cell into two daughter cells.
    *   **Example:** Bacteria
*   **Budding:** A type of asexual reproduction in which a new individual develops from some generative anatomical point of the parent organism.
    *   **Example:** Yeast
*   **Fragmentation:** A form of asexual reproduction where an organism is split into fragments.
    *   **Example:** Spirogyra
*   **Spore Formation:** A method of asexual reproduction in which an organism produces spores, which are small, single-celled reproductive bodies that are capable of growing into a new organism.
    *   **Example:** Fungi
*   **Vegetative Propagation:** A type of asexual reproduction in which new plants grow from the vegetative parts of a parent plant, such as the roots, stems, or leaves.
    *   **Example:** Potato
*   **Artificial Propagation by Tissue Culture:** A method of asexual reproduction in which a small piece of plant tissue is grown in a laboratory to produce a new plant.
    *   **Example:** Orchids

### Sexual Reproduction

*   **Parts of a Typical Flower:**
    *   **Calyx:** The outermost whorl of a flower, consisting of sepals.
    *   **Corolla:** The whorl of a flower inside the calyx, consisting of petals.
    *   **Androecium:** The male reproductive organ of a flower, consisting of stamens.
    *   **Gynoecium:** The female reproductive organ of a flower, consisting of carpels.
*   **Pollination:**
    *   **Self-Pollination:** The transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma of the same flower or another flower on the same plant.
    *   **Cross-Pollination:** The transfer of pollen from the anther of a flower on one plant to the stigma of a flower on another plant of the same species.
*   **Agents of Pollination:**
    *   **Insects:** Flowers pollinated by insects are usually large, brightly colored, and have a sweet scent.
    *   **Water:** Flowers pollinated by water are usually small and inconspicuous.
    *   **Wind:** Flowers pollinated by wind are usually small, inconspicuous, and do not have a scent.
*   **Fertilization:**
    *   Pollen grain lands on stigma.
    *   Pollen tube grows down to ovule.
    *   Male gamete fuses with female gamete.
    *   Zygote is formed.
*   **Artificial Pollination:** The process of transferring pollen from the anther of a flower to the stigma of another flower by hand.

## Animals

### Sexual Reproduction in Humans

*   **Male Reproductive System:**
    *   **Testes:** Produce sperm and testosterone.
    *   **Scrotum:** A sac of skin that holds the testes.
    *   **Epididymis:** A long, coiled tube that stores sperm.
    *   **Vas Deferens:** A tube that carries sperm from the epididymis to the urethra.
    *   **Urethra:** A tube that carries both urine and sperm out of the body.
    *   **Penis:** The male organ of copulation.
*   **Female Reproductive System:**
    *   **Ovaries:** Produce eggs and estrogen.
    *   **Fallopian Tubes:** Tubes that carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus.
    *   **Uterus:** A muscular organ where a fertilized egg implants and develops.
    *   **Cervix:** The lower part of the uterus.
    *   **Vagina:** A muscular tube that connects the cervix to the outside of the body.
