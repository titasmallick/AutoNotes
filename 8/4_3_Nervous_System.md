# Nervous System

## Types of Nerves

*   **Sensory Nerves:** Nerves that carry signals from the sense organs to the brain.
*   **Motor Nerves:** Nerves that carry signals from the brain to the muscles and glands.
*   **Mixed Nerves:** Nerves that contain both sensory and motor fibers.

## Cranial and Spinal Nerves

*   **Cranial Nerves:** Nerves that emerge directly from the brain.
    *   **Number:** 12 pairs
*   **Spinal Nerves:** Nerves that emerge from the spinal cord.
    *   **Number:** 31 pairs

## Structure of a Motor Neuron

*   **Cell Body:** The main part of the neuron, which contains the nucleus.
*   **Dendrites:** Branch-like extensions that receive signals from other neurons.
*   **Axon:** A long, slender projection that carries signals away from the cell body.

## Central Nervous System (CNS)

*   **Brain:** The control center of the nervous system.
*   **Spinal Cord:** A long, thin, tubular bundle of nervous tissue and support cells that extends from the medulla oblongata in the brainstem to the lumbar region of the vertebral column.

## Reflex Action

*   **Definition:** An involuntary and nearly instantaneous movement in response to a stimulus.
*   **Basic Terms:**
    *   **Stimulus:** A thing or event that evokes a specific functional reaction in an organ or tissue.
    *   **Response:** A reaction to a stimulus.
    *   **Impulse:** A signal that is transmitted along a nerve fiber.
    *   **Receptor:** An organ or cell able to respond to light, heat, or other external stimulus and transmit a signal to a sensory nerve.
    *   **Effector:** An organ or cell that acts in response to a stimulus.
*   **Common Examples:**
    *   Withdrawing your hand from a hot object.
    *   Blinking when something comes close to your eye.
