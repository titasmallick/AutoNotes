# Diseases

Communicable diseases, also known as infectious or transmissible diseases, are illnesses that spread from one person to another, or from an animal to a person. These diseases are caused by pathogens, which include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa.

## Communicable Diseases

| Disease | Causative Agent | Symptoms | Prevention |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Influenza** | Virus | Fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches | Vaccination, hand washing, covering coughs and sneezes |
| **Measles** | Virus | Fever, rash, cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes | Vaccination |
| **Malaria** | Protozoan | Fever, chills, sweating, headache, muscle aches | Mosquito nets, antimalarial drugs, mosquito control |
| **Dengue** | Virus | Fever, headache, rash, muscle and joint pains | Mosquito control |
| **Chikungunya** | Virus | Fever, joint pain, headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, rash | Mosquito control |
| **HIV** | Virus | Weakened immune system, leading to opportunistic infections | Condoms, avoiding infected blood, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) |

## Vector

**Meaning:** An organism that transmits a disease from one animal or plant to another. Many vectors are bloodsucking insects that ingest disease-producing microorganisms from an infected host and then transmit them to a new host.

**Common Vectors and the Diseases They Carry:**

*   **Mosquitoes:** Malaria, Dengue fever, West Nile virus, Zika virus.
*   **Ticks:** Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
*   **Fleas:** Plague.
*   **Flies:** Can mechanically transmit diseases like pink eye and salmonellosis.

## Preventing Diseases

A multi-faceted approach is essential for preventing and controlling the spread of communicable diseases.

*   **Personal Hygiene:**
    *   **Frequent Handwashing:** Washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is crucial.
    *   **Covering Coughs and Sneezes:** Use a tissue or your elbow to prevent the spread of respiratory droplets.
    *   **Safe Food Handling:** Wash hands, utensils, and surfaces when preparing food. Cook foods to their proper temperatures and refrigerate them promptly.
    *   **Avoiding Sharing Personal Items:** Do not share items like toothbrushes, razors, or towels.
    *   **Staying Home When Sick:** This helps prevent the spread of illness to others.
*   **Vector Control:**
    *   **Habitat and Environmental Control:** Eliminating breeding grounds for vectors, such as stagnant water.
    *   **Reducing Contact:** Using window screens, bed nets, and wearing protective clothing.
    *   **Chemical Control:** The use of insecticides, larvicides, and personal repellents.
    *   **Biological Control:** Introducing natural predators, such as fish that consume mosquito larvae.
*   **Vaccination:** The administration of a vaccine to help the immune system develop protection from a disease.
*   **Immunization:** The process whereby a person is made immune or resistant to an infectious disease, typically by the administration of a vaccine. Widespread vaccination programs have led to the eradication or significant reduction of diseases like smallpox, polio, and measles.

## Harmful Effects

*   **Consuming Tobacco:** Increased risk of cancer (especially lung cancer), heart disease, stroke, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
*   **Drinking Alcohol:** Increased risk of liver disease, cancer, heart disease, and addiction.
*   **Taking Drugs:** Increased risk of addiction, overdose, death, and various health problems depending on the drug.
