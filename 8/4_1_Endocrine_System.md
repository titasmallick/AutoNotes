# Endocrine System

The endocrine system is a complex network of glands and organs that uses hormones to regulate a multitude of bodily functions. It acts as a chemical messenger system, working alongside the nervous system to control everything from growth and development to metabolism and mood.

## Glands

*   **Exocrine Glands:** Glands that secrete their products into ducts that lead to the target organ. Examples include sweat glands and salivary glands.
*   **Endocrine Glands:** Ductless glands that secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream.

## Hormone

**Definition:** A chemical substance produced in the body that controls and regulates the activity of certain cells or organs. There are over 50 different hormones in the body, and they are essential for life and overall health.

## Hormonal Glands

| Gland | Location | Secretion | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hypothalamus** | Brain | Releasing and inhibiting hormones | Links the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland. Controls the pituitary by producing hormones that tell it to start or stop making other hormones. |
| **Pituitary Gland** | Brain | Growth hormone, TSH, FSH, etc. | Often called the "master gland," the pituitary is crucial for growth, metabolism, and reproduction. It controls other endocrine glands. |
| **Pineal Gland** | Brain | Melatonin | Helps regulate sleep-wake cycles. |
| **Thyroid Gland** | Neck | Thyroxine | Regulates metabolism, growth, and development. |
| **Parathyroid Glands** | Neck | Parathyroid hormone | Controls the amount of calcium in the blood. |
| **Adrenal Glands** | Above kidneys | Adrenaline, Corticosteroids | Prepares the body for 'fight or flight' response, regulates metabolism, immune response, and blood pressure. |
| **Pancreas** | Abdomen | Insulin, Glucagon | Regulates blood sugar levels. |
| **Gonads (Testes/Ovaries)** | Pelvic region | Testosterone (males), Estrogen and Progesterone (females) | Responsible for puberty, sperm production, and the menstrual cycle. |

## Adolescence and Accompanying Changes

Adolescence is the transitional stage from childhood to adulthood that occurs between ages 13 and 19. The physical and psychological changes that take place in adolescence are prompted by hormones.

*   **Physical Changes:** Growth spurt, development of secondary sexual characteristics (e.g., breast development in girls, voice deepening in boys).
*   **Emotional Changes:** Mood swings, increased self-consciousness, and development of a sense of identity.

## Personal Hygiene

*   **Importance:** During adolescence, the sweat and sebaceous glands become more active, making personal hygiene even more important to prevent the spread of disease and maintain good health.

## Stress Management

*   **Meaning of Stress:** A state of mental or emotional strain or tension resulting from adverse or very demanding circumstances.
*   **Ways to Tackle Stress:**
    *   Yoga
    *   Meditation
    *   Time management
    *   Sports
    *   Hobbies
    *   Rational thinking
    *   Getting enough sleep
    *   Eating a healthy diet
