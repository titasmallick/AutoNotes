# Ecosystems

An ecosystem is a community of living organisms (biotic components) interacting with their non-living (abiotic) environment. These interactions form a system where energy and nutrients are transferred. The term "ecosystem" was first used by English botanist A.G. Tansley in 1935.

## Understanding Ecosystems

*   **Definition:** A biological community of interacting organisms and their physical environment.
*   **Interaction between Biotic and Abiotic Factors:** The living and non-living components of an ecosystem interact with each other to create a stable system. Energy flows from one trophic level to the next, starting with the sun's energy captured by producers. Ecosystems also cycle essential nutrients between biotic and abiotic components.

## Biotic Components

Biotic components are the living parts of an ecosystem, such as plants, animals, and microorganisms. They are categorized by how they get nutrition:

*   **Producers (or autotrophs):** Organisms that produce their own food, usually through photosynthesis. Plants are a prime example.
*   **Consumers (or heterotrophs):** Organisms that obtain their food by eating other organisms. They can be primary consumers (herbivores), secondary consumers (carnivores or omnivores), or tertiary consumers.
*   **Decomposers (or saprotrophs):** Organisms that break down dead organic matter, such as bacteria and fungi.

## Food Chain, Food Web, and Pyramid of Numbers

*   **Food Chain:** A series of organisms in which each organism is the food of the next. Energy flows from one trophic level to the next.
*   **Food Web:** A system of interconnected food chains, showing the complex feeding relationships in an ecosystem.
*   **Pyramid of Numbers:** A graphical representation of the number of organisms at each trophic level in a food chain. It shows that the number of organisms decreases as you go up the food chain.

## Interdependence between Organisms

*   **Symbiosis:** A close and long-term interaction between two different biological species.
*   **Parasitism:** A relationship between two organisms in which one organism, the parasite, benefits at the expense of the other, the host.
*   **Predation:** A biological interaction where one organism, the predator, kills and eats another organism, its prey.

## Abiotic Components

Abiotic components are the non-living chemical and physical parts of an ecosystem.

*   **Air:** The mixture of gases that surrounds the Earth.
*   **Soil:** The upper layer of earth in which plants grow, providing nutrients and support.
*   **Water:** A colorless, transparent, odorless, tasteless liquid that forms the seas, lakes, rivers, and rain and is the basis of the fluids of living organisms.
*   **Climatic Factors:**
    *   **Sunlight:** The primary source of energy for most ecosystems.
    *   **Temperature:** The degree or intensity of heat present in a substance or object, which affects the rate of metabolic reactions.
    *   **Humidity:** The amount of water vapor in the air.
    *   **Wind:** The perceptible natural movement of the air, which can affect temperature and humidity.

## Types of Ecosystems

Ecosystems are broadly categorized into two types:

*   **Terrestrial Ecosystems:** These are land-based ecosystems.
    *   **Forest Ecosystems:** Dominated by trees, these are vital for biodiversity.
    *   **Grassland Ecosystems:** Characterized by vast open spaces of grass.
    *   **Desert Ecosystems:** Very dry and often hot environments.
    *   **Tundra Ecosystems:** Cold, windy, and with little rainfall.
*   **Aquatic Ecosystems:** These are water-based ecosystems.
    *   **Freshwater Ecosystems:** Include rivers, lakes, and wetlands.
    *   **Marine Ecosystems:** Include oceans and coral reefs.

## Forest Ecosystem

*   **Flora:** The plants of a particular region, habitat, or geological period.
*   **Fauna:** The animals of a particular region, habitat, or geological period.
