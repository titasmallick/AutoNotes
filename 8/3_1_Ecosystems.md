# Ecosystems

## Understanding Ecosystems

*   **Definition:** A biological community of interacting organisms and their physical environment.
*   **Interaction between Biotic and Abiotic Factors:** The living and non-living components of an ecosystem interact with each other to create a stable system.

## Biotic Components

*   **Producers:** Organisms that produce their own food, such as plants.
*   **Consumers:** Organisms that obtain their food by eating other organisms.
*   **Decomposers:** Organisms that break down dead organic matter, such as bacteria and fungi.

## Food Chain, Food Web, and Pyramid of Numbers

*   **Food Chain:** A series of organisms in which each organism is the food of the next.
*   **Food Web:** A system of interconnected food chains.
*   **Pyramid of Numbers:** A graphical representation of the number of organisms at each trophic level in a food chain.

## Interdependence between Organisms

*   **Symbiosis:** A close and long-term interaction between two different biological species.
*   **Parasitism:** A relationship between two organisms in which one organism, the parasite, benefits at the expense of the other, the host.
*   **Predation:** A biological interaction where one organism, the predator, kills and eats another organism, its prey.

## Abiotic Components

*   **Air:** The mixture of gases that surrounds the Earth.
*   **Soil:** The upper layer of earth in which plants grow.
*   **Water:** A colorless, transparent, odorless, tasteless liquid that forms the seas, lakes, rivers, and rain and is the basis of the fluids of living organisms.
*   **Climatic Factors:**
    *   **Sunlight:** The light from the sun.
    *   **Temperature:** The degree or intensity of heat present in a substance or object.
    *   **Humidity:** The amount of water vapor in the air.
    *   **Wind:** The perceptible natural movement of the air.

## Forest Ecosystem

*   **Flora:** The plants of a particular region, habitat, or geological period.
*   **Fauna:** The animals of a particular region, habitat, or geological period.
