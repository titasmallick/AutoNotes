# Food Production

## Horticulture

Horticulture is a branch of agriculture that focuses on the intensive cultivation of plants used by people for food, medicinal purposes, and aesthetic gratification. This includes a wide range of plants such as fruits, vegetables, flowers, trees, shrubs, and ornamental plants. Horticulture is often characterized by its emphasis on scientific methods, plant breeding, and technical cultivation practices, typically on a smaller and more controlled scale compared to general agriculture.

*   **Vegetables:** Edible parts of plants, such as leaves, stems, roots, and fruits, cultivated for human consumption.
*   **Fruits:** The sweet, fleshy product of a tree or other plant that contains seed and can be eaten as food.
*   **Decorative Plants and Flowers:** Plants grown for their aesthetic appeal, used in landscaping, interior decoration, and floral arrangements.

## Organic Farming and Green Revolution

### Organic Farming

Organic farming is a production system that largely avoids or excludes the use of synthetic inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides, growth regulators, and livestock feed additives. Instead, it relies on natural processes and materials, including crop rotations, crop residues, animal manure, green manure, and biological pest control methods. The core aim of organic farming is to maintain soil productivity and health, supply plant nutrients, and control pests naturally, promoting sustainability, biodiversity, and overall agro-ecosystem health.

*   **Key Principles:** Emphasis on natural processes, biodiversity, and sustainability, avoiding synthetic chemicals.

### Green Revolution

The Green Revolution, also known as the Third Agricultural Revolution, was a period primarily from the mid-20th century (roughly 1940s to 1980s) marked by significant increases in global crop yields. This was achieved through the widespread adoption of new technologies and practices, including the development and introduction of high-yielding varieties (HYVs) of staple crops, particularly wheat and rice. Key components of the Green Revolution also included the increased use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and advanced irrigation techniques. The primary goal was to boost agricultural production, especially in developing countries like Mexico and India, to combat hunger and achieve food self-sufficiency.

*   **Impact:** Increased food production, especially in developing countries, but also raised concerns about environmental impact (e.g., degradation and loss of biodiversity) and sustainability due to its reliance on chemical inputs.

### Relationship between the Concepts

Horticulture is a specific domain within agriculture. Organic farming is a philosophical and practical approach to agriculture that can be applied to various agricultural domains, including horticulture. In contrast, the Green Revolution represents a historical period and a set of practices that largely diverge from organic farming principles, as it heavily relied on synthetic chemical inputs and monoculture to maximize yields.
