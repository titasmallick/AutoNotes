# Chapter 5: Human Physiology

## (i) Breathing and Exchange of Gases

### Organs of Respiration
*   **Respiratory Tract:** Nostrils → Pharynx → Larynx → Trachea → Bronchi → Bronchioles → Alveoli.
*   **Lungs:** Primary respiratory organs, located in the thoracic cavity, enclosed by a double-layered pleural membrane.
*   **Diaphragm:** A muscular septum separating the thoracic and abdominal cavities, crucial for breathing.

### Mechanism of Breathing
*   **Inspiration (Inhalation):**
    *   Diaphragm contracts (flattens).
    *   External intercostal muscles contract, pulling ribs and sternum upwards and outwards.
    *   Thoracic cavity volume increases, leading to a decrease in intra-pulmonary pressure (less than atmospheric pressure).
    *   Air rushes into the lungs.
*   **Expiration (Exhalation):**
    *   Diaphragm relaxes (arches upwards).
    *   External intercostal muscles relax, allowing ribs and sternum to return to original position.
    *   Thoracic cavity volume decreases, leading to an increase in intra-pulmonary pressure (greater than atmospheric pressure).
    *   Air is expelled from the lungs.

### Exchange of Gases (O2 and CO2)
*   Occurs by simple diffusion, primarily at two sites:
    1.  **Alveoli and Blood (Lungs):**
        *   PO2 (partial pressure of O2) is high in alveoli, low in deoxygenated blood. O2 diffuses from alveoli to blood.
        *   PCO2 (partial pressure of CO2) is high in deoxygenated blood, low in alveoli. CO2 diffuses from blood to alveoli.
    2.  **Blood and Tissues:**
        *   PO2 is high in oxygenated blood, low in tissues. O2 diffuses from blood to tissues.
        *   PCO2 is high in tissues, low in oxygenated blood. CO2 diffuses from tissues to blood.

### Transport of Gases
*   **Transport of Oxygen (O2):**
    *   **97% by Hemoglobin:** O2 binds reversibly with hemoglobin (Hb) in red blood cells to form oxyhemoglobin (HbO2). Each Hb molecule can carry 4 O2 molecules.
    *   **3% in dissolved state:** Carried in plasma.
    *   **Factors affecting O2 binding to Hb:** PO2 (most important), PCO2, H+ concentration, temperature, 2,3-BPG.
*   **Transport of Carbon Dioxide (CO2):**
    *   **70% as Bicarbonate Ions (HCO3-):** CO2 reacts with water in RBCs (catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase) to form carbonic acid (H2CO3), which dissociates into H+ and HCO3-. HCO3- moves into plasma.
    *   **20-25% as Carbaminohemoglobin:** CO2 binds to the amino groups of hemoglobin.
    *   **7-10% in dissolved state:** Carried in plasma.
*   **Chloride Shift (Hamburger Phenomenon):** To maintain electrical neutrality, as HCO3- ions move out of RBCs into plasma, chloride (Cl-) ions move from plasma into RBCs.

### Respiratory Volumes and Capacities
*   **Tidal Volume (TV):** Volume of air inspired or expired during a normal respiration (approx. 500 mL).
*   **Inspiratory Reserve Volume (IRV):** Additional volume of air that can be inspired by a forceful inspiration (approx. 2500-3000 mL).
*   **Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV):** Additional volume of air that can be expired by a forceful expiration (approx. 1000-1100 mL).
*   **Residual Volume (RV):** Volume of air remaining in the lungs after a maximal forceful expiration (approx. 1100-1200 mL).
*   **Inspiratory Capacity (IC):** TV + IRV.
*   **Expiratory Capacity (EC):** TV + ERV.
*   **Functional Residual Capacity (FRC):** ERV + RV.
*   **Vital Capacity (VC):** IRV + ERV + TV (maximum volume of air a person can breathe in after a forced expiration, or breathe out after a forced inspiration).
*   **Total Lung Capacity (TLC):** VC + RV (total volume of air in the lungs after a maximal inspiration).

### Disorders of Respiratory System
*   **Asthma:** Difficulty in breathing due to inflammation and constriction of bronchi and bronchioles.
*   **Emphysema:** Chronic disorder where alveolar walls are damaged, reducing respiratory surface. Caused by cigarette smoking.
*   **Occupational Respiratory Disorders:** Caused by prolonged exposure to dust (e.g., Silicosis, Asbestosis).

## (ii) Body Fluids and Circulation

### Blood Composition
*   **Plasma (55%):** Fluid matrix, contains water (90-92%), proteins (albumin, globulins, fibrinogen), glucose, amino acids, minerals, hormones, etc.
*   **Formed Elements (45%):**
    *   **Erythrocytes (RBCs):** Biconcave, anucleated (in mammals), contain hemoglobin, transport O2 and some CO2.
    *   **Leukocytes (WBCs):** Nucleated, colorless, involved in immunity.
        *   **Granulocytes:** Neutrophils (phagocytic), Eosinophils (allergic reactions, parasitic infections), Basophils (inflammatory reactions, release histamine, serotonin, heparin).
        *   **Agranulocytes:** Lymphocytes (B and T cells, immune response), Monocytes (phagocytic).
    *   **Platelets (Thrombocytes):** Cell fragments, involved in blood clotting.

### Blood Groups (ABO and Rh)
*   **ABO Blood Grouping:** Based on the presence or absence of two surface antigens on RBCs (A and B) and two natural antibodies in plasma (anti-A and anti-B).
    *   **Group A:** Antigen A, Antibody anti-B.
    *   **Group B:** Antigen B, Antibody anti-A.
    *   **Group AB:** Antigens A and B, No antibodies (Universal Recipient).
    *   **Group O:** No antigens, Antibodies anti-A and anti-B (Universal Donor).
*   **Rh Grouping:** Based on the presence or absence of Rh antigen (D antigen) on RBCs.
    *   **Rh positive (Rh+):** Has Rh antigen.
    *   **Rh negative (Rh-):** Lacks Rh antigen. Develops anti-Rh antibodies if exposed to Rh+ blood.
    *   **Erythroblastosis fetalis:** A severe hemolytic disease of a newborn, occurs when an Rh- mother carries an Rh+ fetus.

### Blood Clotting (Coagulation)
*   **Mechanism:** A cascade process involving various clotting factors.
    1.  Injury to blood vessel exposes tissue factor.
    2.  Platelets aggregate at the site of injury, forming a platelet plug.
    3.  Prothrombin (inactive) is converted to Thrombin (active) by the enzyme complex Thrombokinase (Prothrombinase).
    4.  Thrombin converts Fibrinogen (soluble plasma protein) to Fibrin (insoluble protein).
    5.  Fibrin forms a mesh-like network that traps formed elements, forming a clot.

### Heart Structure
*   **Location:** Thoracic cavity, between the lungs, slightly tilted to the left.
*   **Chambers:** Four chambers – two upper smaller atria (auricles) and two lower larger ventricles.
*   **Valves:** Prevent backflow of blood.
    *   **Tricuspid valve:** Between right atrium and right ventricle.
    *   **Bicuspid (Mitral) valve:** Between left atrium and left ventricle.
    *   **Semilunar valves:** At the origin of pulmonary artery (from right ventricle) and aorta (from left ventricle).
*   **Conduction System:** Specialized cardiac musculature.
    *   **Sinoatrial Node (SAN):** Pacemaker of the heart, generates action potentials.
    *   **Atrioventricular Node (AVN):** Relays impulses from atria to ventricles.
    *   **Bundle of His and Purkinje fibers:** Conduct impulses to ventricular muscles.

### Working of the Heart (Cardiac Cycle)
*   **Cardiac Cycle:** The sequential event in the heart which is cyclically repeated (systole and diastole of atria and ventricles).
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Joint Diastole:** All four chambers are relaxed. Blood flows from vena cava and pulmonary veins into atria and then into ventricles.
    2.  **Atrial Systole:** Atria contract, pushing remaining blood into ventricles.
    3.  **Ventricular Systole:** Ventricles contract. First, AV valves close (producing 'lub' sound). Then semilunar valves open, and blood is pumped into pulmonary artery and aorta.
    4.  **Ventricular Diastole:** Ventricles relax. Semilunar valves close (producing 'dub' sound). AV valves open.
*   **Cardiac Output:** Volume of blood pumped by each ventricle per minute (Stroke volume × Heart rate).

### Electrocardiogram (ECG)
*   **Definition:** A graphical representation of the electrical activity of the heart during a cardiac cycle.
*   **Waves:**
    *   **P-wave:** Depolarization of atria (atrial contraction).
    *   **QRS complex:** Depolarization of ventricles (ventricular contraction).
    *   **T-wave:** Repolarization of ventricles (ventricular relaxation).

### Blood Vessels
*   **Arteries:** Carry oxygenated blood away from the heart (except pulmonary artery).
*   **Veins:** Carry deoxygenated blood towards the heart (except pulmonary vein).
*   **Capillaries:** Microscopic vessels, site of exchange of nutrients, gases, and wastes between blood and tissues.

### Lymph (Tissue Fluid)
*   **Formation:** Formed when blood plasma and WBCs filter out from capillaries into the intercellular spaces.
*   **Composition:** Similar to plasma but lacks large proteins and RBCs.
*   **Functions:** Transport nutrients, O2, hormones to cells; remove CO2 and metabolic wastes; part of the immune system.
*   **Lymphatic System:** Network of lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes, and lymphoid organs (spleen, tonsils, thymus) that collect lymph and return it to the blood circulation.

### Disorders of Circulatory System
*   **Hypertension (High Blood Pressure):** Sustained elevated blood pressure (e.g., 140/90 mmHg or higher).
*   **Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) / Atherosclerosis:** Narrowing of coronary arteries due to plaque formation (fat, cholesterol, fibrous tissue).
*   **Angina Pectoris:** Acute chest pain due to insufficient oxygen reaching heart muscles.
*   **Heart Failure:** Heart is not pumping blood effectively enough to meet the body's needs.
*   **Cardiac Arrest:** Heart stops beating.
*   **Heart Attack:** Heart muscle is suddenly damaged due to inadequate blood supply.

## (iii) Excretion

### Modes of Excretion
*   **Ammonotelism:** Excretion of ammonia (highly toxic, requires large water for elimination). Common in aquatic animals (e.g., bony fishes, aquatic amphibians, aquatic insects).
*   **Ureotelism:** Excretion of urea (less toxic than ammonia, requires less water). Common in mammals, terrestrial amphibians, marine fishes.
*   **Uricotelism:** Excretion of uric acid (least toxic, requires minimal water). Common in reptiles, birds, land snails, insects.

    *   **Medulla:** Inner striated region, divided into medullary pyramids.
*   **Renal Pelvis:** Large funnel-shaped space inner to the hilum, collecting urine.
*   **Ureters:** Tubes carrying urine from kidneys to urinary bladder.
*   **Urinary Bladder:** Stores urine temporarily.
*   **Urethra:** Tube through which urine is expelled from the body.

### Nephron (Structural and Functional Unit of Kidney)
*   **Parts of a Nephron:**
    1.  **Malpighian Corpuscle (Renal Corpuscle):**
        *   **Glomerulus:** Tuft of capillaries, filters blood.
        *   **Bowman's Capsule:** Double-walled cup-like structure enclosing the glomerulus.
    2.  **Renal Tubule:**
        *   **Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT):** Highly coiled, reabsorbs most of the useful substances.
        *   **Henle's Loop:** Hairpin-shaped, maintains concentration gradient.
        *   **Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT):** Highly coiled, conditional reabsorption.
        *   **Collecting Duct:** Straight tube, collects urine from many nephrons.

### Urine Formation
1.  **Glomerular Filtration (Ultrafiltration):** Blood is filtered from the glomerulus into Bowman's capsule, forming glomerular filtrate (primary urine). Filtration is non-selective.
2.  **Reabsorption:** Useful substances (glucose, amino acids, Na+, water) are reabsorbed from the filtrate back into the blood. Can be active or passive.
3.  **Tubular Secretion:** Waste products (K+, H+, creatinine, drugs) are secreted from the blood into the filtrate, ensuring their removal and maintaining ionic and acid-base balance.

### Regulation of Kidney Function
*   **Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) / Vasopressin:**
    *   **Source:** Hypothalamus (released by posterior pituitary).
    *   **Action:** Increases water reabsorption in DCT and collecting duct, preventing water loss (antidiuresis).
*   **Atrial Natriuretic Factor (ANF):**
    *   **Source:** Atrial wall of heart.
    *   **Action:** Decreases blood pressure by causing vasodilation and inhibiting renin-angiotensin mechanism, leading to increased Na+ and water excretion.
*   **Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Drop in glomerular blood flow/pressure stimulates juxtaglomerular cells to release Renin.
    *   Renin converts Angiotensinogen to Angiotensin I, then to Angiotensin II.
    *   Angiotensin II is a powerful vasoconstrictor (increases BP) and stimulates adrenal cortex to release Aldosterone.
    *   Aldosterone increases Na+ and water reabsorption in DCT and collecting duct, increasing blood volume and pressure.
*   **Erythropoietin:**
    *   **Source:** Juxtaglomerular cells of kidney.
    *   **Action:** Stimulates erythropoiesis (formation of RBCs) in bone marrow.

### Disorders of Excretory System
*   **Uraemia:** Accumulation of urea and other nitrogenous wastes in the blood due to kidney malfunction.
*   **Acute Renal Failure:** Sudden loss of kidney function.
*   **Nephritis:** Inflammation of the kidney (e.g., Glomerulonephritis).
*   **Renal Calculi (Kidney Stones):** Formation of insoluble crystalline salts (e.g., calcium oxalates) within the kidney.
*   **Dialysis (Hemodialysis):** Artificial kidney used to remove urea and other wastes from the blood in case of kidney failure.
*   **Kidney Transplant:** Surgical replacement of a damaged kidney with a healthy one from a donor.

## (iv) Locomotion and Movement

*   **Bones:** Hard, rigid connective tissue.
    *   **Axial Skeleton:** Skull, vertebral column, sternum, ribs.
    *   **Appendicular Skeleton:** Bones of limbs and girdles (pectoral and pelvic).
*   **Joints:** Points where two or more bones meet.
    *   **Fibrous Joints:** Immovable (e.g., sutures in skull).
    *   **Cartilaginous Joints:** Limited movement (e.g., between vertebrae).
    *   **Synovial Joints:** Freely movable, characterized by a synovial cavity with synovial fluid (e.g., Ball and socket - shoulder, hip; Hinge - elbow, knee; Pivot - atlas and axis; Gliding - carpals; Saddle - thumb).

### Types of Muscles
*   **Skeletal Muscles (Striated/Voluntary):** Attached to bones, responsible for locomotion and body movements. Striated appearance, multinucleated.
*   **Smooth Muscles (Non-striated/Involuntary):** Found in walls of internal organs (e.g., digestive tract, blood vessels). No striations, uninucleated.
*   **Cardiac Muscles (Striated/Involuntary):** Found only in the heart wall. Striated, branched, uninucleated, interconnected by intercalated discs.

### Muscle Contraction (Sliding Filament Theory)
*   **Mechanism:** Proposed by Huxley and Niedergerke.
    1.  **Neural Signal:** A motor neuron releases acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction.
    2.  **Action Potential:** Generates an action potential in the muscle fiber, which spreads through the sarcolemma and T-tubules.
    3.  **Ca2+ Release:** Action potential triggers the release of Ca2+ ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the sarcoplasm.
    4.  **Cross-bridge Formation:** Ca2+ binds to troponin, causing a conformational change that exposes the myosin-binding sites on actin filaments. Myosin heads bind to actin, forming cross-bridges.
    5.  **Power Stroke:** Myosin heads pivot, pulling the actin filaments towards the center of the sarcomere (H-zone disappears). ATP is hydrolyzed to provide energy.
    6.  **Cross-bridge Detachment:** A new ATP molecule binds to the myosin head, causing it to detach from actin.
    7.  **Re-cocking of Myosin Head:** ATP hydrolysis re-cocks the myosin head.
    8.  **Relaxation:** Ca2+ is pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, covering the binding sites on actin, and the muscle relaxes.

### Red and White Muscles
*   **Red Muscles (Slow-twitch fibers):**
    *   **Characteristics:** Rich in myoglobin (red pigment, stores O2), many mitochondria, rich blood supply.
    *   **Function:** Sustained, prolonged contractions (e.g., postural muscles).
*   **White Muscles (Fast-twitch fibers):**
    *   **Characteristics:** Less myoglobin (pale), fewer mitochondria, less blood supply, more sarcoplasmic reticulum.
    *   **Function:** Rapid, short-duration contractions (e.g., muscles of eyeball).

### Disorders of Muscular and Skeletal System
*   **Myasthenia Gravis:** Autoimmune disorder affecting neuromuscular junction, leading to fatigue, weakening, and paralysis of skeletal muscles.
*   **Muscular Dystrophy:** Progressive degeneration of skeletal muscles, mostly due to genetic disorder.
*   **Tetany:** Rapid spasms (wild contractions) in muscles due to low Ca2+ in body fluid.
*   **Arthritis:** Inflammation of joints.
*   **Osteoporosis:** Age-related disorder characterized by decreased bone mass and increased chances of fractures, due to decreased estrogen levels.
*   **Gout:** Inflammation of joints due to accumulation of uric acid crystals.

## (v) Neural Control and Coordination

### Neuron (Nerve Cell)
*   **Structure:**
    *   **Cell Body (Soma/Cyton):** Contains nucleus and Nissl's granules (ribosomes).
    *   **Dendrites:** Short, branched processes, receive impulses.
    *   **Axon:** Long, slender process, transmits impulses away from cell body.
*   **Types of Neurons:**
    *   **Multipolar:** One axon, two or more dendrites (e.g., cerebral cortex).
    *   **Bipolar:** One axon, one dendrite (e.g., retina).
    *   **Unipolar:** Cell body with one process that divides into axon and dendrite (e.g., embryonic stage).

### Brain and Spinal Cord (Central Nervous System - CNS)
*   **Brain:**
    *   **Forebrain:** Cerebrum (largest part, cerebral cortex, responsible for voluntary actions, memory, intelligence), Thalamus (relay station for sensory and motor signals), Hypothalamus (controls body temperature, hunger, thirst, emotions, endocrine functions).
    *   **Midbrain:** Connects forebrain and hindbrain, involved in visual and auditory reflexes.
    *   **Hindbrain:** Pons (relays signals between cerebrum and cerebellum), Cerebellum (maintains balance, coordination of voluntary movements), Medulla Oblongata (controls vital functions like breathing, heart rate, blood pressure).
*   **Spinal Cord:** Extends from medulla oblongata, conducts nerve impulses to and from the brain, controls reflexes.

### Conduction of Nerve Impulse
*   **Resting Membrane Potential:** Neuron membrane is polarized (more positive outside, more negative inside) due to differential permeability to Na+ and K+ ions and Na+/K+ pump.
*   **Depolarization (Action Potential):** When a stimulus is applied, Na+ channels open, Na+ rushes in, making the inside positive.
*   **Repolarization:** K+ channels open, K+ rushes out, restoring the negative charge inside.
*   **Refractory Period:** Brief period during which the neuron cannot generate another action potential.
*   **Saltatory Conduction:** In myelinated neurons, action potential jumps from one Node of Ranvier to another, increasing speed of conduction.

### Synapse Transmission
*   **Synapse:** Junction between two neurons or between a neuron and an effector (muscle/gland).
*   **Types:**
    *   **Electrical Synapse:** Direct flow of current through gap junctions. Faster but less common.
    *   **Chemical Synapse:** Involves neurotransmitters.
*   **Mechanism of Chemical Synapse:**
    1.  Action potential arrives at presynaptic terminal.
    2.  Ca2+ channels open, Ca2+ influx.
    3.  Neurotransmitter vesicles fuse with presynaptic membrane, releasing neurotransmitters into synaptic cleft.
    4.  Neurotransmitters bind to receptors on postsynaptic membrane.
    5.  Binding causes opening of ion channels, generating a new potential (excitatory or inhibitory) in the postsynaptic neuron.
    6.  Neurotransmitters are quickly removed from the synaptic cleft.

## (vi) Chemical Coordination and Integration

### Endocrine Glands and Hormones
*   **Endocrine Glands:** Ductless glands that secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream.
*   **Hormones:** Non-nutrient chemicals that act as intercellular messengers, produced in trace amounts.

    *   **Testes (Males):** Androgens (testosterone) (male secondary sexual characteristics).
    *   **Ovaries (Females):** Estrogen, Progesterone (female secondary sexual characteristics, menstrual cycle, pregnancy).

### Hormone Action Mechanism
*   **Hormones acting through cAMP (Second Messenger System):**
    1.  Protein hormones (e.g., FSH) bind to receptors on the cell membrane.
    2.  This activates adenyl cyclase, which converts ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP).
    3.  cAMP acts as a second messenger, activating protein kinases, leading to a cascade of biochemical reactions and cellular response.
*   **Steroid Hormones (Intracellular Receptors):**
    1.  Steroid hormones (e.g., estrogen) are lipid-soluble and pass through the cell membrane.
    2.  They bind to intracellular receptors (in cytoplasm or nucleus) to form a hormone-receptor complex.
    3.  The complex binds to specific DNA sequences, activating or inhibiting gene expression.
    4.  This leads to the synthesis of new proteins and cellular response.
