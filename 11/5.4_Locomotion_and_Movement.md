# Chapter 5.4: Locomotion and Movement

## 1. Types of Movement
- **Movement:** The change in position of a part of the body relative to its axis.
- **Locomotion:** The movement of an organism from one place to another.
- **Types of Movement in Organisms:**
    - **Amoeboid Movement:** By pseudopodia formed by the streaming of protoplasm. e.g., Amoeba, macrophages, leucocytes.
    - **Ciliary Movement:** By cilia. e.g., Paramecium, in the trachea to remove dust particles, in the fallopian tubes to move the ovum.
    - **Flagellar Movement:** By flagella. e.g., Euglena, spermatozoa.
    - **Muscular Movement:** By muscles. Most common type of movement in higher animals.

## 2. Skeleton
- **Definition:** The framework of bones and cartilage that provides support, protection, and allows for movement.
- **Types:**
    - **Axial Skeleton:** Consists of the skull, vertebral column, sternum, and ribs.
        - **Skull:** Cranium (8 bones), facial bones (14 bones), hyoid bone (1), ear ossicles (Malleus, Incus, Stapes - 3 pairs).
        - **Vertebral Column:** 26 serially arranged vertebrae (Cervical 7, Thoracic 12, Lumbar 5, Sacral 1 fused, Coccygeal 1 fused).
        - **Sternum:** A flat bone on the ventral midline of the thorax.
        - **Ribs:** 12 pairs. True ribs (1-7 pairs), False ribs (8-10 pairs), Floating ribs (11-12 pairs).
    - **Appendicular Skeleton:** Consists of the bones of the limbs and their girdles.
        - **Pectoral Girdle:** Clavicle and Scapula. Connects the upper limb to the axial skeleton.
        - **Pelvic Girdle:** Two coxal bones. Connects the lower limb to the axial skeleton.
        - **Bones of Upper Limb:** Humerus, Radius, Ulna, Carpals (8), Metacarpals (5), Phalanges (14).
        - **Bones of Lower Limb:** Femur, Patella, Tibia, Fibula, Tarsals (7), Metatarsals (5), Phalanges (14).

## 3. Joints
- **Definition:** Points of articulation between two or more bones, or between a bone and cartilage.
- **Types:**
    - **Fibrous Joints:** Do not allow any movement. e.g., Sutures in the skull.
    - **Cartilaginous Joints:** Allow limited movement. Bones are joined by cartilage. e.g., Between vertebrae.
    - **Synovial Joints:** Allow considerable movement. Characterized by the presence of a fluid-filled synovial cavity between the articulating surfaces of the two bones. e.g., Ball and socket joint (shoulder, hip), Hinge joint (knee, elbow), Pivot joint (atlas and axis), Gliding joint (carpals), Saddle joint (thumb).

## 4. Muscle Structure
- **Types of Muscles:**
    - **Skeletal Muscles:** Striated, voluntary, attached to bones.
    - **Smooth Muscles:** Non-striated, involuntary, found in internal organs.
    - **Cardiac Muscles:** Striated, involuntary, found in the heart.
- **Skeletal Muscle Structure:**
    - Each muscle is made of many muscle bundles (fascicles).
    - Each fascicle contains many muscle fibres.
    - **Muscle Fibre (Cell):** Syncytium (multinucleated), contains sarcoplasm (cytoplasm), sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER), and myofibrils.
    - **Myofibril:** Composed of repeating units called sarcomeres.
    - **Sarcomere:** The functional unit of muscle contraction. Contains two types of protein filaments:
        - **Actin (Thin Filament):** Lighter band (I-band).
        - **Myosin (Thick Filament):** Darker band (A-band).
    - **Z-line:** Bisects the I-band. Sarcomere is the region between two successive Z-lines.
    - **H-zone:** Central part of the A-band, where only myosin is present.
    - **M-line:** Bisects the H-zone.

## 5. Sliding Filament Theory of Muscle Contraction
- **Mechanism:** Muscle contraction is explained by the sliding of thin filaments (actin) over thick filaments (myosin).
- **Steps:**
    1. **Neural Signal:** A signal from the central nervous system (CNS) reaches the neuromuscular junction.
    2. **Neurotransmitter Release:** Acetylcholine is released, generating an action potential in the sarcolemma.
    3. **Calcium Release:** The action potential spreads through the muscle fibre, causing the release of Ca²⁺ ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the sarcoplasm.
    4. **Actin-Myosin Binding:** Ca²⁺ binds to troponin on the actin filaments, causing a conformational change that exposes the myosin-binding sites on actin.
    5. **Cross-Bridge Formation:** Myosin heads bind to the exposed active sites on actin, forming cross-bridges.
    6. **Power Stroke:** The myosin head pulls the actin filament towards the center of the sarcomere (M-line). ATP is hydrolyzed to provide energy for this movement.
    7. **Cross-Bridge Detachment:** A new ATP molecule binds to the myosin head, causing it to detach from actin.
    8. **Myosin Head Re-cocking:** The ATP is hydrolyzed, and the myosin head returns to its original position, ready for another cycle.
    9. **Relaxation:** When the neural signal stops, Ca²⁺ is pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, leading to the unbinding of myosin from actin and muscle relaxation.

## 6. Disorders of Muscular and Skeletal System
- **Myasthenia Gravis:** An autoimmune disorder affecting neuromuscular junction leading to fatigue, weakening and paralysis of skeletal muscle.
- **Tetany:** Rapid spasms (wild contractions) in muscle due to low Ca²⁺ in body fluid.
- **Arthritis:** Inflammation of joints.
- **Osteoporosis:** Age-related disorder characterized by decreased bone mass and increased chances of fractures. Decreased levels of estrogen is a common cause.
- **Gout:** Inflammation of joints due to accumulation of uric acid crystals.
