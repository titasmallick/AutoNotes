# Chapter 1.3: Plant Kingdom

## Introduction
Plants are multicellular, eukaryotic, and autotrophic organisms. Their cells have a cell wall made of cellulose. The plant kingdom is broadly divided into Algae, Bryophytes, Pteridophytes, Gymnosperms, and Angiosperms.

## 1. Algae
- **Characteristics:** Simple, thalloid (no true roots, stem, or leaves), and largely aquatic (both freshwater and marine) organisms. They are chlorophyll-bearing and photosynthetic.
- **Reproduction:**
    - **Vegetative:** Fragmentation.
    - **Asexual:** Production of different types of spores, most commonly zoospores.
    - **Sexual:** Fusion of two gametes. Can be isogamous (similar gametes), anisogamous (dissimilar gametes), or oogamous (large, non-motile female gamete and a smaller, motile male gamete).
- **Classification:** Based on the type of pigment and stored food.
    - **Chlorophyceae (Green Algae):**
        - **Pigments:** Chlorophyll a and b.
        - **Stored Food:** Starch.
        - **Cell Wall:** Cellulose.
        - **Examples:** *Chlamydomonas*, *Volvox*, *Ulothrix*, *Spirogyra*, *Chara*.
    - **Phaeophyceae (Brown Algae):**
        - **Pigments:** Chlorophyll a, c, and fucoxanthin.
        - **Stored Food:** Mannitol and laminarin.
        - **Cell Wall:** Cellulose and algin.
        - **Examples:** *Ectocarpus*, *Dictyota*, *Laminaria*, *Sargassum*, *Fucus*.
    - **Rhodophyceae (Red Algae):**
        - **Pigments:** Chlorophyll a, d, and phycoerythrin.
        - **Stored Food:** Floridean starch.
        - **Cell Wall:** Cellulose, pectin, and polysulphate esters.
        - **Examples:** *Polysiphonia*, *Porphyra*, *Gracilaria*, *Gelidium*.
- **Economic Importance:**
    - At least half of the total CO₂ fixation on Earth is carried out by algae.
    - Many species like *Porphyra*, *Laminaria*, and *Sargassum* are used as food.
    - Agar, used in microbiology and to make ice-creams and jellies, is obtained from *Gelidium* and *Gracilaria*.
    - Algin (from brown algae) and carrageenan (from red algae) are used as hydrocolloids (water-holding substances).

## 2. Bryophyta (Amphibians of the Plant Kingdom)
- **Characteristics:** Live in soil but depend on water for sexual reproduction. The main plant body is a haploid gametophyte. True roots, stem, and leaves are absent.
- **Groups:**
    - **Liverworts:** e.g., *Marchantia*. The plant body is a thallus. Asexual reproduction by fragmentation or gemmae.
    - **Mosses:** e.g., *Funaria*, *Polytrichum*, *Sphagnum*. The life cycle has two stages: a protonema stage (creeping, green, branched) and a leafy stage (upright, slender axis with spirally arranged leaves).
- **Life Cycle of *Funaria* (a Moss):** Exhibits alternation of generations. The gametophyte is the dominant, photosynthetic phase. The sporophyte is partially dependent on the gametophyte for nutrition. Spores germinate to form the protonema.
- **Economic Importance:**
    - *Sphagnum* (a moss) provides peat, used as fuel and as packing material for trans-shipment of living material because of its water-holding capacity.
    - Mosses are important in soil formation and prevent soil erosion.

## 3. Pteridophyta (First Terrestrial Plants with Vascular Tissues)
- **Characteristics:** Found in cool, damp, shady places. The main plant body is a diploid sporophyte, which is differentiated into true root, stem, and leaves. They possess vascular tissues (xylem and phloem).
- **Life Cycle:** The sporophyte bears sporangia that produce spores by meiosis. Spores germinate to form a small, multicellular, free-living, photosynthetic gametophyte called a prothallus. The prothallus requires water for fertilization.
- **Spore Types:**
    - **Homospory:** Produce spores of a single kind (most pteridophytes).
    - **Heterospory:** Produce two kinds of spores, macro (mega) and micro spores. This is a precursor to the seed habit. Examples: *Selaginella* and *Salvinia*.
- **Classes:**
    - **Psilopsida:** e.g., *Psilotum*
    - **Lycopsida:** e.g., *Selaginella*, *Lycopodium*
    - **Sphenopsida:** e.g., *Equisetum* (horsetail)
    - **Pteropsida:** e.g., *Dryopteris*, *Pteris*, *Adiantum* (ferns)

## 4. Gymnosperms (Naked Seed Plants)
- **General Features:** Plants in which the ovules are not enclosed by any ovary wall and remain exposed, both before and after fertilization. The seeds that develop post-fertilization are naked.
- **Characteristics:** Include medium-sized trees or tall trees and shrubs. The roots are generally tap roots. Roots in some genera have fungal association in the form of mycorrhiza (*Pinus*), while in others (*Cycas*) small specialized roots called coralloid roots are associated with N₂-fixing cyanobacteria.
- **Life Cycle of *Pinus*:**
    - *Pinus* is a monoecious plant, bearing both male and female cones on the same tree.
    - **Male Cones:** Bear microsporophylls, which have microsporangia that produce haploid microspores (pollen grains).
    - **Female Cones:** Bear megasporophylls, which have ovules containing a megasporangium. The megasporangium produces a haploid megaspore, which develops into the female gametophyte.
    - **Pollination:** Wind carries pollen grains to the ovules.
    - **Fertilization:** The pollen tube carries the male gametes to the archegonium (in the female gametophyte), and fertilization occurs.
    - **Seed Development:** The zygote develops into an embryo, and the ovule develops into a seed. The seed is not enclosed in a fruit.
- **Economic Importance:**
    - Source of timber and wood pulp.
    - Turpentine and resins are obtained from pine trees.
    - Seeds of *Pinus gerardiana* (chilgoza) are edible.
