### Endocrine Glands: Hypothalamus, Pituitary, Thyroid, Parathyroid, Adrenals, Pancreas, Gonads

The endocrine system is a system of glands that secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream to regulate various bodily functions. These glands are ductless glands.

#### 1. Hypothalamus
*   **Location:** Basal part of the diencephalon, forebrain.
*   **Function:** Acts as a neuro-endocrine organ. Contains neurosecretory cells that produce releasing hormones (e.g., GnRH, TRH, CRH, GHRH) and inhibiting hormones (e.g., Somatostatin/GHIH, PIH). These hormones regulate the secretion of hormones from the anterior pituitary gland. It also produces oxytocin and vasopressin (ADH), which are transported to and released by the posterior pituitary.

#### 2. Pituitary Gland (Hypophysis)
*   **Location:** Sella turcica, a bony cavity of the sphenoid bone, attached to the hypothalamus by a stalk.
*   **Divisions:**
    *   **Adenohypophysis (Anterior Pituitary):**
        *   **Pars Distalis:** Produces Growth Hormone (GH), Prolactin (PRL), Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH).
        *   **Pars Intermedia:** In humans, it is almost merged with pars distalis. Secretes Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone (MSH).
    *   **Neurohypophysis (Posterior Pituitary):**
        *   **Pars Nervosa:** Stores and releases Oxytocin and Vasopressin (ADH), which are synthesized by the hypothalamus.

#### 3. Thyroid Gland
*   **Location:** On either side of the trachea, in the neck region, composed of two lobes connected by an isthmus.
*   **Structure:** Composed of follicles and stromal tissues. Each thyroid follicle is composed of follicular cells enclosing a cavity.
*   **Hormones:**
    *   **Thyroxine (T4) and Triiodothyronine (T3):** Synthesized from iodine and tyrosine. Regulate basal metabolic rate (BMR), physical, mental, and sexual development, erythropoiesis, and carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism.
    *   **Thyrocalcitonin (TCT):** A protein hormone that regulates blood calcium levels (lowers them).

#### 4. Parathyroid Glands
*   **Location:** Four small glands located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland, two in each lobe.
*   **Hormone:**
    *   **Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) / Collip's Hormone:** A peptide hormone. Increases blood calcium levels (hypercalcemic hormone) by stimulating bone resorption, reabsorption of Ca2+ by renal tubules, and absorption of Ca2+ from digested food.

#### 5. Adrenal Glands
*   **Location:** One at the anterior part of each kidney (supra-renal glands).
*   **Divisions:**
    *   **Adrenal Cortex (Outer part):** Divided into three layers: zona reticularis (inner), zona fasciculata (middle), and zona glomerulosa (outer).
        *   **Glucocorticoids (e.g., Cortisol):** Regulate carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism; anti-inflammatory; suppress immune response.
        *   **Mineralocorticoids (e.g., Aldosterone):** Regulate water and electrolyte balance.
        *   **Androgenic Steroids:** Small amounts of sex hormones.
    *   **Adrenal Medulla (Inner part):**
        *   **Adrenaline (Epinephrine) and Noradrenaline (Norepinephrine):** Catecholamines, also known as emergency hormones or hormones of fight or flight. Increase alertness, pupillary dilation, piloerection, sweating, heart beat, strength of heart contraction, and rate of respiration.

#### 6. Pancreas
*   **Location:** Mixed gland (exocrine and endocrine) located behind the stomach.
*   **Endocrine part:** Islets of Langerhans, containing:
    *   **Alpha (α) cells:** Secrete **Glucagon** (raises blood glucose levels).
    *   **Beta (β) cells:** Secrete **Insulin** (lowers blood glucose levels).

#### 7. Gonads
*   **Primary sex organs** that produce gametes and sex hormones.
    *   **Testes (in males):**
        *   **Location:** Scrotum.
        *   **Hormones:** **Androgens (e.g., Testosterone):** Regulate development, maturation, and functions of male accessory sex organs, secondary sexual characteristics, spermatogenesis, and libido.
    *   **Ovaries (in females):**
        *   **Location:** Abdomen.
        *   **Hormones:**
            *   **Estrogen:** Regulates development of female secondary sexual characteristics, development of growing ovarian follicles, and female reproductive tract.
            *   **Progesterone:** Supports pregnancy, acts on mammary glands for milk secretion.

### Mechanism of Hormone Action: cAMP, Steroid Pathways

Hormones exert their effects by binding to specific receptors on target cells. Based on their chemical nature, hormones can be broadly classified into two groups, each with a distinct mechanism of action:

#### 1. Protein/Peptide Hormones (e.g., Insulin, Glucagon, Pituitary Hormones, Catecholamines)
These hormones are water-soluble and generally do not enter the target cell. They bind to receptors located on the cell membrane.

**Mechanism (Second Messenger System - e.g., cAMP):**
1.  **Hormone-Receptor Binding:** The hormone (first messenger) binds to a specific receptor on the outer surface of the target cell membrane.
2.  **Activation of G-protein:** This binding activates an associated G-protein.
3.  **Activation of Adenylate Cyclase:** The activated G-protein then activates the enzyme adenylate cyclase, located on the inner side of the cell membrane.
4.  **cAMP Formation:** Adenylate cyclase catalyzes the conversion of ATP into cyclic AMP (cAMP), which acts as a second messenger.
5.  **Activation of Protein Kinases:** cAMP activates various protein kinases.
6.  **Phosphorylation and Cellular Response:** Protein kinases phosphorylate other enzymes and proteins within the cell, leading to a cascade of biochemical reactions and ultimately the specific physiological response (e.g., metabolic changes, secretion).

Other second messengers include Ca2+, IP3 (inositol triphosphate), and DAG (diacylglycerol).

#### 2. Steroid Hormones (e.g., Cortisol, Estrogen, Testosterone, Progesterone) and Thyroid Hormones (T3, T4)
These hormones are lipid-soluble and can easily pass through the cell membrane to enter the target cell. Their receptors are located inside the cell (intracellular receptors).

**Mechanism (Intracellular Receptors):**
1.  **Hormone Entry:** The steroid or thyroid hormone diffuses across the cell membrane and enters the cytoplasm.
2.  **Hormone-Receptor Complex Formation:** The hormone binds to a specific intracellular receptor (either in the cytoplasm or nucleus) to form a hormone-receptor complex.
3.  **Translocation to Nucleus:** The hormone-receptor complex then translocates into the nucleus.
4.  **Gene Expression Regulation:** In the nucleus, the hormone-receptor complex binds to specific DNA sequences (hormone response elements) on the chromatin.
5.  **mRNA and Protein Synthesis:** This binding regulates gene expression, leading to the transcription of specific genes into mRNA.
6.  **Cellular Response:** The mRNA is then translated into specific proteins (enzymes or structural proteins) that bring about the physiological and developmental effects of the hormone.

### Disorders: Dwarfism, Goitre, Diabetes, Addison’s Disease

#### 1. Dwarfism
*   **Cause:** Hyposecretion of Growth Hormone (GH) from the anterior pituitary gland during the growth period (childhood).
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, abnormally short stature, but usually with normal body proportions and intelligence.

#### 2. Goitre
*   **Cause:** Primarily due to deficiency of iodine in the diet, leading to hyposecretion of thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism).
*   **Symptoms:** Enlargement of the thyroid gland (swelling in the neck). Can also be caused by hyperthyroidism (Exophthalmic Goitre/Graves' disease) where the thyroid gland enlarges and protrudes eyeballs.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Simple Goitre:** Due to iodine deficiency.
    *   **Exophthalmic Goitre (Graves' Disease):** A form of hyperthyroidism characterized by an enlarged thyroid gland, increased BMR, weight loss, nervousness, and protrusion of the eyeballs (exophthalmos).

#### 3. Diabetes
*   **Diabetes Mellitus:**
    *   **Cause:** Prolonged hyperglycemia (high blood glucose) due to either insufficient insulin secretion (Type 1 Diabetes) or the body's cells not responding to insulin (insulin resistance, Type 2 Diabetes).
    *   **Symptoms:** Polyuria (frequent urination), polydipsia (increased thirst), polyphagia (increased hunger), weight loss, blurred vision, fatigue, slow-healing sores.
    *   **Complications:** Can lead to kidney failure, nerve damage, heart disease, and blindness if untreated.
*   **Diabetes Insipidus:**
    *   **Cause:** Hyposecretion of Vasopressin (ADH) from the posterior pituitary or inability of the kidneys to respond to ADH.
    *   **Symptoms:** Excessive urination (polyuria) and extreme thirst (polydipsia) due to the inability to reabsorb water in the kidneys. Unlike Diabetes Mellitus, it does not involve blood glucose levels.

#### 4. Addison’s Disease
*   **Cause:** Hyposecretion of hormones from the adrenal cortex, particularly glucocorticoids (cortisol) and mineralocorticoids (aldosterone).
*   **Symptoms:** Chronic fatigue, muscle weakness, weight loss, low blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hyperpigmentation of the skin (bronzing), and salt craving. Can lead to an adrenal crisis (life-threatening drop in blood pressure and severe symptoms) if untreated.
