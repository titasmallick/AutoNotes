# Kingdom Animalia: The Animal Kingdom

## Introduction

Kingdom Animalia includes all eukaryotic, multicellular, heterotrophic organisms. They are characterized by the absence of a cell wall and their ability to move, although some are sessile. The study of animals is called zoology.

## Basis of Classification

Animals are classified based on several fundamental features:

### 1. Levels of Organisation

*   **Cellular Level:** The body is an aggregation of cells with a rudimentary division of labor. Example: Phylum Porifera.
*   **Tissue Level:** Cells performing the same function are arranged into tissues. Example: Phylum Cnidaria and Ctenophora.
*   **Organ Level:** Tissues are grouped together to form organs, each specialized for a particular function. Example: Phylum Platyhelminthes.
*   **Organ System Level:** Organs are associated to form functional systems, each system concerned with a specific physiological function. Example: Phyla Nematoda to Chordata.

### 2. Body Plan

*   **Cell Aggregate Plan:** The body consists of a cluster of cells with little to no coordination between them. Example: Sponges.
*   **Blind-Sac Plan:** The body has a single opening that serves as both mouth and anus. Example: Cnidarians, Platyhelminthes.
*   **Tube-within-Tube Plan:** The body has a complete digestive tract with two separate openings, a mouth for ingestion and an anus for egestion. Example: Nematodes to Chordates.

### 3. Symmetry

*   **Spherical Symmetry:** The body can be divided into two identical halves by any plane passing through the center. Example: *Volvox*.
*   **Radial Symmetry:** The body can be divided into two identical halves by any plane passing through the central axis. Example: Cnidarians, Ctenophores, Echinoderms.
*   **Bilateral Symmetry:** The body can be divided into identical left and right halves in only one plane. Example: Platyhelminthes to Chordates.

### 4. Germ Layers

*   **Diploblastic:** The body cells are arranged in two embryonic layers, an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm. An undifferentiated layer, mesoglea, is present between the ectoderm and the endoderm. Example: Cnidaria, Ctenophora.
*   **Triploblastic:** The body cells are arranged in three embryonic layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Example: Platyhelminthes to Chordates.

### 5. Coelom (Body Cavity)

The coelom is the body cavity lined by mesoderm.

*   **Acoelomate:** The body cavity is absent. The space between the body wall and the digestive tract is filled with a matrix called parenchyma. Example: Platyhelminthes.
*   **Pseudocoelomate:** The body cavity is not lined by mesoderm. The mesoderm is present as scattered pouches in between the ectoderm and endoderm. Example: Nematoda (Aschelminthes).
*   **Coelomate:** The body cavity is a true coelom, lined by mesoderm on all sides. Example: Annelida to Chordata.
*   **Haemocoelomate:** The coelom is filled with blood (haemolymph). Example: Arthropoda, Mollusca.

### 6. Segmentation

In some animals, the body is externally and internally divided into segments with a serial repetition of at least some organs. This phenomenon is called metamerism. Example: Annelida, Arthropoda, Chordata.

## Non-Chordata

Non-chordates are animals that do not possess a notochord.

### Phylum Porifera (Sponges)

1.  **Level of Organisation:** Cellular level.
2.  **Symmetry:** Mostly asymmetrical.
3.  **Canal System:** They have a water transport or canal system. Water enters through minute pores (ostia) in the body wall into a central cavity (spongocoel), from where it goes out through the osculum.
4.  **Choanocytes:** The spongocoel is lined with flagellated cells called choanocytes or collar cells.
5.  **Skeleton:** The body is supported by a skeleton made up of spicules or spongin fibers.

*   **Examples:** *Sycon* (Scypha), *Spongilla* (Freshwater sponge).

### Phylum Cnidaria (Coelenterata)

1.  **Level of Organisation:** Tissue level.
2.  **Symmetry:** Radial symmetry.
3.  **Cnidoblasts:** They have stinging cells called cnidoblasts or cnidocytes, containing stinging capsules or nematocysts.
4.  **Body Forms:** They exhibit two basic body forms: a sessile, cylindrical polyp (e.g., *Hydra*, *Adamsia*) and a free-swimming, umbrella-shaped medusa (e.g., *Aurelia* or jellyfish).
5.  **Alternation of Generation (Metagenesis):** Some cnidarians exhibit alternation of generation, where polyps produce medusae asexually and medusae form the polyps sexually (e.g., *Obelia*).
