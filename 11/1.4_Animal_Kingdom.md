# Chapter 1.4: Animal Kingdom

## 1. Basis of Classification
Animals are classified based on fundamental features like:
- **Levels of Organization:**
    - **Cellular Level:** Cells are arranged as loose aggregates. e.g., Phylum Porifera.
    - **Tissue Level:** Cells performing the same function are arranged into tissues. e.g., Coelenterata, Ctenophora.
    - **Organ Level:** Tissues are grouped together to form organs, each specialized for a particular function. e.g., Platyhelminthes.
    - **Organ System Level:** Organs are associated to form functional systems. e.g., Annelids, Arthropods, Molluscs, Echinoderms, Chordates.
- **Symmetry:**
    - **Asymmetrical:** Any plane that passes through the center does not divide them into equal halves. e.g., Sponges.
    - **Radial Symmetry:** Any plane passing through the central axis of the body divides the organism into two identical halves. e.g., Coelenterates, Ctenophores, Echinoderms (adults).
    - **Bilateral Symmetry:** The body can be divided into identical left and right halves in only one plane. e.g., Annelids, Arthropods, etc.
- **Germ Layers:**
    - **Diploblastic:** Cells are arranged in two embryonic layers, an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm. An undifferentiated layer, mesoglea, is present in between. e.g., Coelenterates.
    - **Triploblastic:** A third germinal layer, mesoderm, is present between the ectoderm and endoderm. e.g., Platyhelminthes to Chordates.
- **Coelom (Body Cavity):** The cavity lined by mesoderm.
    - **Acoelomate:** The body cavity is absent. e.g., Platyhelminthes.
    - **Pseudocoelomate:** The body cavity is not lined by mesoderm; instead, the mesoderm is present as scattered pouches. e.g., Aschelminthes.
    - **Coelomate:** The body cavity is lined by mesoderm. e.g., Annelids to Chordates.

## 2. Non-Chordates

### Phylum Porifera (Sponges)
- **Habitat:** Generally marine, some are freshwater.
- **Organization:** Cellular level.
- **Symmetry:** Mostly asymmetrical.
- **Key Features:** Presence of a water transport or canal system. Water enters through minute pores (ostia) into a central cavity (spongocoel), from where it goes out through the osculum. This pathway helps in food gathering, respiratory exchange, and removal of waste. The body is supported by a skeleton made up of spicules or spongin fibres. Hermaphrodite.
- **Examples:** *Sycon* (Scypha), *Spongilla* (freshwater sponge), *Euspongia* (bath sponge).

### Phylum Coelenterata (Cnidaria)
- **Habitat:** Aquatic, mostly marine, sessile or free-swimming.
- **Organization:** Tissue level, diploblastic.
- **Symmetry:** Radial.
- **Key Features:** Presence of cnidoblasts or cnidocytes (stinging cells) on the tentacles and the body. They have a central gastro-vascular cavity with a single opening, the mouth on the hypostome. Exhibit two basic body forms: polyp (sessile and cylindrical, e.g., *Hydra*) and medusa (umbrella-shaped and free-swimming, e.g., *Aurelia* or jellyfish). Some exhibit alternation of generation (metagenesis).
- **Examples:** *Physalia* (Portuguese man-of-war), *Adamsia* (Sea anemone), *Pennatula* (Sea-pen), *Gorgonia* (Sea-fan), *Meandrina* (Brain coral).

### Phylum Platyhelminthes (Flatworms)

- **Habitat:** Mostly endoparasites.
- **Organization:** Organ level, triploblastic, acoelomate.
- **Symmetry:** Bilateral.
- **Key Features:** Hooks and suckers are present in the parasitic forms. Specialized cells called flame cells help in osmoregulation and excretion. Hermaphrodite.
- **Examples:** *Taenia* (Tapeworm), *Fasciola* (Liver fluke).

### Phylum Aschelminthes (Roundworms)
- **Body Form:** Circular in cross-section.
- **Habitat:** Free-living, aquatic and terrestrial or parasitic.

- **Examples:** *Ascaris* (Roundworm), *Wuchereria* (Filaria worm), *Ancylostoma* (Hookworm).

### Phylum Annelida
- **Habitat:** Aquatic or terrestrial; free-living, and sometimes parasitic.
- **Organization:** Organ system level, triploblastic, coelomate.
- **Symmetry:** Bilateral.
- **Key Features:** Body is metamerically segmented. They possess longitudinal and circular muscles which help in locomotion. A closed circulatory system is present. Nephridia help in osmoregulation and excretion.
- **Examples:** *Nereis*, *Pheretima* (Earthworm), *Hirudinaria* (Blood sucking leech).

### Phylum Arthropoda (Largest Phylum)
- **Organization:** Organ system level, triploblastic, coelomate.
- **Symmetry:** Bilateral.
- **Key Features:** Body is covered by a chitinous exoskeleton. The body consists of head, thorax, and abdomen. They have jointed appendages. Respiratory organs are gills, book gills, book lungs or tracheal system. Circulatory system is of open type. Excretion takes place through Malpighian tubules.
- **Examples:**
    - Economically important insects: *Apis* (Honey bee), *Bombyx* (Silkworm)
    - Vectors: *Anopheles*, *Culex*, *Aedes* (Mosquitoes)
    - Living fossil: *Limulus* (King crab).

### Phylum Mollusca (Second Largest Phylum)
- **Habitat:** Terrestrial or aquatic.
- **Organization:** Organ system level, triploblastic, coelomate.
- **Symmetry:** Bilateral.
- **Key Features:** Body is covered by a calcareous shell and is unsegmented with a distinct head, muscular foot, and visceral hump. A soft and spongy layer of skin forms a mantle over the visceral hump. The space between the hump and the mantle is called the mantle cavity in which feather-like gills are present. The mouth contains a file-like rasping organ for feeding, called a radula.
- **Examples:** *Pila* (Apple snail), *Pinctada* (Pearl oyster), *Sepia* (Cuttlefish), *Loligo* (Squid), *Octopus* (Devil fish).

### Phylum Echinodermata (Spiny Bodied)

They are homoiothermous. e.g., *Ornithorhynchus* (Platypus - oviparous), *Macropus* (Kangaroo - viviparous), *Pteropus* (Flying fox), *Homo* (Man).
