# Chapter 3: Cell: Structure and Function

## (i) Cell â€“ The Unit of Life

### Cell Theory
*   **Proposed by:** Matthias Schleiden (1838) and Theodor Schwann (1839).
*   **Original Postulates:**
    1.  All living organisms are composed of cells and products of cells.
    2.  All cells arise from pre-existing cells (added by Rudolf Virchow in 1855).
*   **Modern Cell Theory:**
    1.  The cell is the fundamental unit of structure and function in all living organisms.
    2.  All cells arise from pre-existing cells.
    3.  All cells contain hereditary information (DNA) which is passed from parent cell to daughter cell.
    4.  All cells are basically the same in chemical composition and metabolic activities.
    5.  Energy flow (metabolism and biochemistry) occurs within cells.

## (iii) Cell Cycle and Cell Division

### Cell Cycle
*   **Definition:** The sequence of events that occur in a cell between one cell division and the next.
*   **Phases:**
    *   **Interphase (Preparatory Phase):** The longest phase, where the cell grows and prepares for division.
        *   **G1 Phase (Gap 1):** Cell grows, synthesizes proteins and RNA. Organelles duplicate. (First growth phase).
        *   **S Phase (Synthesis):** DNA replication occurs, and the amount of DNA doubles. Chromosome number remains the same. Histone proteins are synthesized.
        *   **G2 Phase (Gap 2):** Cell continues to grow, synthesizes proteins and RNA required for mitosis. (Second growth phase).
    *   **M Phase (Mitotic Phase):** The actual cell division phase.
        *   **Mitosis:** Nuclear division (karyokinesis) followed by cytoplasmic division (cytokinesis).
        *   **Meiosis:** Reductional division.
    *   **G0 Phase (Quiescent Stage):** Some cells (e.g., heart cells, nerve cells) exit the cell cycle and enter an inactive stage. They can re-enter the cell cycle if needed.

### Mitosis
*   **Definition:** Equational division, where the number of chromosomes in the parent cell is conserved in the daughter cells. Occurs in somatic cells for growth and repair.
*   **Phases of Karyokinesis (Nuclear Division):**
    *   **Prophase:** Chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes. Centrioles move to opposite poles, forming spindle fibers. Nuclear envelope and nucleolus disappear.
    *   **Metaphase:** Chromosomes align at the equatorial plate (metaphase plate). Spindle fibers attach to kinetochores of sister chromatids.
    *   **Anaphase:** Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles, becoming individual chromosomes. Centromere divides.
    *   **Telophase:** Chromosomes decondense at poles. Nuclear envelope and nucleolus reappear. Spindle fibers disappear.
*   **Cytokinesis (Cytoplasmic Division):**
    *   **Animal Cells:** Formation of a cleavage furrow that deepens and divides the cytoplasm.
    *   **Plant Cells:** Formation of a cell plate in the center, which grows outwards to form a new cell wall.
*   **Significance:** Growth, repair, replacement of old cells, asexual reproduction.

### Meiosis
*   **Definition:** Reductional division, where the number of chromosomes is halved in the daughter cells. Occurs in germ cells to form gametes (sperms and eggs).
*   **Meiosis I (Reductional Division):**
    *   **Prophase I:** Longest and most complex phase. Divided into Leptotene, Zygotene (synapsis, bivalent formation), Pachytene (crossing over), Diplotene (chiasmata formation), Diakinesis.
    *   **Metaphase I:** Homologous chromosomes align at the equatorial plate.
    *   **Anaphase I:** Homologous chromosomes separate and move to opposite poles. Sister chromatids remain attached.
    *   **Telophase I:** Chromosomes reach poles, nuclear envelope may reform. Cytokinesis follows, forming two haploid cells.
*   **Meiosis II (Equational Division):** Similar to mitosis.
    *   **Prophase II:** Chromosomes condense, nuclear envelope disappears.
    *   **Metaphase II:** Chromosomes align at the equatorial plate.
    *   **Anaphase II:** Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles.
    *   **Telophase II:** Chromosomes decondense, nuclear envelope reforms. Cytokinesis follows, resulting in four haploid daughter cells.
*   **Significance:**
    *   **Maintenance of Chromosome Number:** Ensures that the chromosome number remains constant from generation to generation in sexually reproducing organisms.
    *   **Genetic Variation:** Crossing over during Prophase I leads to recombination of genetic material, causing variation.

### C-value
*   **Definition:** The amount of DNA in a haploid genome (e.g., in a gamete or a bacterial cell). It is typically measured in picograms (pg) or base pairs (bp).
*   **C-value Paradox:** The observation that genome size (C-value) does not correlate with organismal complexity. Some simpler organisms have larger genomes than more complex ones.

### Differences between Mitosis and Meiosis
| Feature           | Mitosis                               | Meiosis                               |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------ |
| **Occurs in**     | Somatic cells                         | Germ cells                            |
| **Number of divisions** | One                                   | Two (Meiosis I & Meiosis II)          |
| **Daughter cells** | Two                                   | Four                                  |
| **Chromosome number** | Same as parent cell (diploid to diploid) | Half of parent cell (diploid to haploid) |
| **Genetic variation** | No (daughter cells are genetically identical) | Yes (due to crossing over)            |
| **Purpose**       | Growth, repair, asexual reproduction  | Gamete formation, genetic variation   |

### Significance of Cell Cycle and Cell Division
*   **Growth:** Increase in the number of cells leads to the growth of an organism.
*   **Repair and Replacement:** Old, damaged, or dead cells are replaced by new ones.
*   **Reproduction:** Essential for both asexual and sexual reproduction.
*   **Genetic Continuity:** Ensures that genetic information is accurately passed from one generation of cells to the next.
*   **Genetic Variation:** Meiosis introduces genetic variation, which is crucial for evolution and adaptation.
