# Chapter 2: Structural Organisation in Animals and Plants

## (i) Morphology of Flowering Plants

### Modifications of Roots
Roots are primarily for absorption of water and minerals and anchorage. They can be modified for various functions:
*   **Storage:**
    *   **Tap Roots:** Swollen for food storage (e.g., Carrot, Radish, Turnip).
    *   **Adventitious Roots:** Swollen for food storage (e.g., Sweet Potato, Asparagus).
*   **Support:**
    *   **Prop Roots:** Grow vertically downwards from horizontal branches into the soil, providing support (e.g., Banyan tree).
    *   **Stilt Roots:** Grow obliquely from the base of the stem, providing support (e.g., Maize, Sugarcane).
    *   **Climbing Roots:** Help plants climb by clinging to supports (e.g., Money Plant, Betel).
*   **Respiration (Pneumatophores):** Found in mangroves (halophytes) growing in marshy areas. They grow vertically upwards from the main root, with pores (lenticels) for gaseous exchange (e.g., *Rhizophora*).
*   **Haustorial/Sucking Roots:** Parasitic roots that penetrate the host plant to absorb nutrients (e.g., *Cuscuta*).
*   **Nodulated Roots:** Contain nitrogen-fixing bacteria in nodules (e.g., Leguminous plants like Pea, Bean).

### Modifications of Stems
Stems are primarily for support, conduction, and bearing leaves, flowers, and fruits. They can be modified for:
*   **Storage:**
    *   **Underground Stems:**
        *   **Rhizome:** Horizontal, underground stem with nodes, internodes, and scale leaves (e.g., Ginger, Turmeric).
        *   **Corm:** Condensed, vertical, underground stem (e.g., Colocasia, Gladiolus).
        *   **Tuber:** Swollen tip of an underground branch, with 'eyes' (nodes) (e.g., Potato).
        *   **Bulb:** Condensed stem with fleshy scale leaves (e.g., Onion, Garlic).
*   **Perennation/Vegetative Propagation:** Many underground stems also help in perennation (surviving unfavorable conditions) and vegetative propagation.
*   **Support:**
    *   **Tendrils:** Slender, spirally coiled structures that help plants climb (e.g., Cucumber, Pumpkin, Grapevine).
*   **Protection:**
    *   **Thorns:** Hard, pointed, woody structures for defense (e.g., *Bougainvillea*, Citrus).
*   **Photosynthesis:**
    *   **Phylloclade:** Flattened or fleshy green stem, performing photosynthesis (e.g., *Opuntia* - flattened, *Euphorbia* - cylindrical).
*   **Vegetative Propagation:**
    *   **Runner:** Slender, prostrate branch that creeps on the ground (e.g., Grass, Strawberry).
    *   **Stolon:** Slender lateral branch arising from the base of the main axis, growing aerially for some distance, then arching downwards to touch the ground (e.g., Mint, Jasmine).
    *   **Offset:** Short, thick runner found in aquatic plants (e.g., *Pistia*, *Eichhornia*).
    *   **Sucker:** Underground stem that grows obliquely upwards, giving rise to a new shoot (e.g., Pineapple, Chrysanthemum).

### Modifications of Leaves
Leaves are primarily for photosynthesis. They can be modified for:
*   **Support:**
    *   **Tendrils:** Slender, coiled structures for climbing (e.g., Pea, Gloriosa).
*   **Protection:**
    *   **Spines:** Sharp, pointed structures for defense and reducing water loss (e.g., Cactus, *Opuntia*).
*   **Storage:**
    *   **Fleshy Leaves:** Store food and water (e.g., Onion, Aloe).
*   **Insect Trapping:**
    *   **Pitcher Plant:** Leaf modified into a pitcher-like structure to trap insects (e.g., *Nepenthes*).
    *   **Venus Flytrap:** Leaf modified into a trap with hinged lobes to catch insects (e.g., *Dionaea muscipula*).
*   **Vegetative Propagation:**
    *   **Leaf Buds:** Adventitious buds on leaf margins develop into new plantlets (e.g., *Bryophyllum*).
*   **Phyllode:** Petiole or rachis becomes flattened and green, performing photosynthesis (e.g., Australian Acacia).

### Inflorescence
**Inflorescence:** The arrangement of flowers on the floral axis.

*   **Racemose Inflorescence:**
    *   **Features:** Main axis continues to grow indefinitely, and flowers are borne laterally in an acropetal succession (older flowers at the base, younger towards the apex).
    *   **Examples:** Radish, Mustard, Gulmohar.
*   **Cymose Inflorescence:**
    *   **Features:** Main axis terminates in a flower, hence its growth is limited. Flowers are borne in a basipetal succession (older flowers at the apex, younger towards the base).
    *   **Examples:** Jasmine, Cotton, *Bougainvillea*.

### Flower Parts
**Flower:** The reproductive unit in angiosperms.

*   **Parts of a typical flower:**
    *   **Calyx:** Outermost whorl, made of sepals (usually green, protect the bud).
    *   **Corolla:** Whorl inside calyx, made of petals (usually brightly colored, attract pollinators).
    *   **Androecium:** Male reproductive part, made of stamens (each stamen has an anther and a filament).
    *   **Gynoecium/Pistil:** Female reproductive part, made of carpels (each carpel has an ovary, style, and stigma).

*   **Symmetry of Flower:**
    *   **Actinomorphic (Radial Symmetry):** Can be divided into two equal radial halves by any radial plane passing through the center (e.g., Mustard, Datura, Chilli).
    *   **Zygomorphic (Bilateral Symmetry):** Can be divided into two similar halves only in one particular vertical plane (e.g., Pea, Gulmohar, Bean, Cassia).
    *   **Asymmetrical/Irregular:** Cannot be divided into two equal halves by any vertical plane (e.g., Canna).

*   **Aestivation:** The mode of arrangement of sepals or petals in floral bud with respect to the other members of the same whorl.
    *   **Valvate:** Sepals or petals just touch one another at the margin without overlapping (e.g., Calotropis).
    *   **Twisted:** One margin of the appendage overlaps the next one, and so on (e.g., China rose, Lady's finger, Cotton).
    *   **Imbricate:** Margins overlap but not in a particular direction (e.g., Cassia, Gulmohar).
    *   **Vexillary (Papilionaceous):** The largest petal (standard) overlaps two lateral petals (wings), which in turn overlap the two smallest anterior petals (keel) (e.g., Pea, Bean).

*   **Cohesion:** Fusion of similar floral parts.
    *   **Polyandrous:** Stamens are free (e.g., Mustard).
    *   **Monadelphous:** Stamens united into one bundle (e.g., China rose).
    *   **Diadelphous:** Stamens united into two bundles (e.g., Pea).
    *   **Polyadelphous:** Stamens united into more than two bundles (e.g., Citrus).
    *   **Syncarpous:** Carpels are fused (e.g., Tomato, Mustard).
    *   **Apocarpous:** Carpels are free (e.g., Rose, Lotus).

*   **Adhesion:** Fusion of dissimilar floral parts.
    *   **Epipetalous:** Stamens attached to petals (e.g., Brinjal).
    *   **Epiphyllous:** Stamens attached to perianth (when calyx and corolla are not distinct) (e.g., Lily).

*   **Placentation:** The arrangement of ovules within the ovary.
    *   **Marginal:** Placenta forms a ridge along the ventral suture of the ovary, and ovules are borne on this ridge (e.g., Pea).
    *   **Axile:** Placenta is axial, and ovules are attached to it in a multilocular ovary (e.g., China rose, Tomato, Lemon).
    *   **Parietal:** Ovules develop on the inner wall of the ovary or on peripheral part. Ovary is one-chambered but becomes two-chambered due to false septum formation (e.g., Mustard, *Argemone*).
    *   **Free Central:** Ovules are borne on central axis, and septa are absent. Ovary is unilocular (e.g., *Dianthus*, Primrose).
    *   **Basal:** Placenta develops at the base of the ovary, and a single ovule is attached to it (e.g., Sunflower, Marigold).

## (iii) Structural Organisation in Animals (Frog)

### Brief on Systems of Frog (*Rana tigrina*)

#### Digestive System
*   **Alimentary Canal:** Short, as frogs are carnivores. Consists of mouth, buccal cavity, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and cloaca.
*   **Digestive Glands:** Liver (produces bile) and Pancreas (produces pancreatic juice).
*   **Digestion:** Food (insects) is captured by a bilobed tongue. Digestion occurs in the stomach and intestine. Absorption mainly in the small intestine. Undigested food passes into the rectum and then out through the cloacal aperture.

#### Circulatory System
*   **Closed Type:** Blood flows within blood vessels.
*   **Heart:** Three-chambered (two atria, one ventricle). Receives deoxygenated blood from the body and oxygenated blood from the lungs/skin. Mixing of blood occurs in the ventricle.
*   **Blood Vessels:** Arteries (carry blood away from heart) and Veins (carry blood towards heart).
*   **Portal Systems:** Hepatic portal system (from digestive tract to liver) and Renal portal system (from lower body parts to kidneys) are present.
*   **Blood:** Contains plasma, red blood cells (nucleated), white blood cells, and platelets.

#### Respiratory System
*   **Cutaneous Respiration:** Through moist skin, both on land and in water. Primary mode of respiration in water.
*   **Buccal Respiration:** Through the lining of the buccal cavity, when mouth is closed.
*   **Pulmonary Respiration:** Through lungs, on land. Lungs are a pair of elongated, pinkish, sac-like structures.

#### Excretory System
*   **Kidneys:** A pair of dark red, bean-shaped organs. Excrete nitrogenous waste.
*   **Ureters:** Tubes carrying urine from kidneys to cloaca.
*   **Urinary Bladder:** Stores urine temporarily.
