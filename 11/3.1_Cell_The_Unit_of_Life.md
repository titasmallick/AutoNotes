# Chapter 3.1: Cell - The Unit of Life

## 1. Cell Theory
- Proposed by Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann, and later modified by Rudolf Virchow.
- **Postulates:**
    1. All living organisms are composed of cells and products of cells.
    2. All cells arise from pre-existing cells (*Omnis cellula-e cellula*).

## 2. Cell Types

### Prokaryotic Cell
- **Characteristics:**
    - Lack a membrane-bound nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.
    - Genetic material is naked, not enclosed by a nuclear envelope, and is located in a region called the nucleoid.
    - Have ribosomes (70S type).
    - Cell wall is present (in most cases), made of peptidoglycan.
    - Examples: Bacteria, Blue-green algae (Cyanobacteria), Mycoplasma, PPLO (Pleuro Pneumonia Like Organisms).

### Eukaryotic Cell
- **Characteristics:**
    - Possess an organized nucleus with a nuclear envelope.
    - Have a variety of membrane-bound organelles like mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, lysosomes, etc.
    - Have ribosomes (80S type in the cytoplasm and 70S in mitochondria and plastids).
    - Examples: Protists, Fungi, Plants, and Animals.

### Differences between Plant and Animal Cells
| Feature | Plant Cell | Animal Cell |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Cell Wall | Present (made of cellulose) | Absent |
| Plastids | Present (e.g., chloroplasts) | Absent |
| Vacuole | Large central vacuole | Small and numerous vacuoles |
| Centrioles | Absent (in higher plants) | Present |

## 3. Cell Organelles

### Plasma Membrane
- **Structure:** Described by the **Fluid Mosaic Model** (proposed by Singer and Nicolson). It is a quasi-fluid lipid bilayer with proteins embedded in it (integral proteins) or on the surface (peripheral proteins).
- **Functions:**
    - Regulates the movement of molecules into and out of the cell (selective permeability).
    - **Transport Types:**
        - **Passive Transport:** Movement of molecules across the membrane along the concentration gradient, without any expenditure of energy.
            - **Simple Diffusion:** Movement of neutral solutes.
            - **Osmosis:** Movement of water.
            - **Facilitated Diffusion:** Movement of substances with the help of carrier proteins.
        - **Active Transport:** Movement of molecules against the concentration gradient, which requires energy (ATP).

### Cell Wall
- A rigid, non-living outer covering found in plant cells and fungi. It gives shape to the cell, protects the cell from mechanical damage and infection, and helps in cell-to-cell interaction.

### Endomembrane System
- A group of organelles whose functions are coordinated. It includes the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi complex, lysosomes, and vacuoles.

#### Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)
- A network of tiny tubular structures scattered in the cytoplasm.
- **Types:**
    - **Rough ER (RER):** Bears ribosomes on its surface. Actively involved in protein synthesis and secretion.
    - **Smooth ER (SER):** Ribosomes are absent. It is the major site for synthesis of lipids. In animal cells, lipid-like steroidal hormones are synthesized in SER.

#### Golgi Apparatus (Golgi Complex)
- Consists of flattened sacs (cisternae). It is involved in the processing, packaging, and transport of materials synthesized in the ER.

#### Lysosomes
- Membrane-bound vesicular structures containing hydrolytic enzymes. They are involved in the digestion of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Also known as "suicidal bags".

#### Vacuoles
- Membrane-bound space found in the cytoplasm. In plant cells, the vacuole can occupy up to 90% of the volume of the cell. It contains water, sap, excretory products, and other materials not useful for the cell.

### Mitochondria
- Double membrane-bound structures, known as the "powerhouses" of the cell. They are the sites of aerobic respiration and ATP synthesis.

### Plastids
- Found in all plant cells and in euglenoids. Based on the type of pigments, plastids can be classified into chloroplasts, chromoplasts, and leucoplasts.
    - **Chloroplasts:** Contain chlorophyll and are the site of photosynthesis.
    - **Chromoplasts:** Contain fat-soluble carotenoid pigments like carotene and xanthophylls. They give the part of the plant a yellow, orange or red color.
    - **Leucoplasts:** Colourless plastids of varied shapes and sizes with stored nutrients.

### Ribosomes
- Granular structures composed of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and proteins. They are the site of protein synthesis.

### Cytoskeleton
- A network of filamentous proteinaceous structures present in the cytoplasm. It is involved in many functions such as mechanical support, motility, maintenance of the shape of the cell.

### Cilia and Flagella
- Hair-like outgrowths of the cell membrane. They are involved in locomotion and feeding.

### Centrosome and Centrioles
- Centrosome is an organelle usually containing two cylindrical structures called centrioles. They help in cell division by forming the spindle fibres.

### Nucleus
- A large, spherical organelle that contains the genetic material (DNA) of the cell.
- **Components:**
    - **Nuclear Envelope:** A double membrane that surrounds the nucleus.
    - **Nucleolus:** A dense, spherical structure within the nucleus, which is the site of ribosome synthesis.
    - **Chromatin:** A network of nucleoprotein fibres, which condenses to form chromosomes during cell division.
    - **Chromosomes:** Structures that carry the genetic information. Based on the position of the centromere, chromosomes can be classified into four types: metacentric, sub-metacentric, acrocentric, and telocentric.
