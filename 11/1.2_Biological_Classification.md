# Chapter 1.2: Biological Classification

## 1. Three Domains of Life
Proposed by Carl Woese, this system adds a level of classification above the Kingdom.
- **Archaea:** Domain of prokaryotic organisms that are biochemically distinct from bacteria. They often inhabit extreme environments.
    - **Methanogens:** Obligate anaerobes that produce methane. Found in marshy areas and the gut of ruminants.
    - **Halophiles:** Live in extremely salty environments.
    - **Thermoacidophiles:** Thrive in hot, acidic environments.
- **Bacteria:** Domain of typical prokaryotic organisms. Includes most of the known bacteria.
- **Eukarya:** Domain of all eukaryotic organisms, which have a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.

## 2. Five Kingdom Classification
Proposed by R.H. Whittaker, this is the most widely accepted classification system.

### Kingdom Monera
- **Characteristics:** Unicellular prokaryotes. Lack a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Cell wall is made of peptidoglycan.
- **Bacteria:**
    - **Structure:** Simple, with a cell wall, plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and a nucleoid (containing a single circular chromosome).
    - **Classification by Shape:** Coccus (spherical), Bacillus (rod-shaped), Vibrio (comma-shaped), Spirillum (spiral).
    - **Nutrition:** Autotrophic (photosynthetic or chemosynthetic) or heterotrophic (saprophytic or parasitic).
    - **Respiration:** Aerobic or anaerobic.
    - **Gram Staining:** A technique to differentiate bacteria based on their cell wall composition. Gram-positive bacteria have a thick peptidoglycan layer and stain purple. Gram-negative bacteria have a thin peptidoglycan layer and an outer membrane, and they stain pink.
    - **Reproduction:**
        - **Asexual:** Primarily by binary fission.
        - **Sexual (Genetic Recombination):**
            - **Conjugation:** Transfer of genetic material through a conjugation tube.
            - **Transformation:** Uptake of naked DNA from the surroundings.
            - **Transduction:** Transfer of genetic material by a bacteriophage (virus).
- **Mycoplasma:** The smallest living cells, lack a cell wall, and can survive without oxygen. They are pathogenic in animals and plants.

### Kingdom Protista
- **Characteristics:** Unicellular eukaryotes. Most are aquatic. They form a link between the other kingdoms.
- **Groups:**
    - **Chrysophytes:** Includes diatoms and golden algae (desmids). They are photosynthetic. Diatoms have siliceous cell walls that form diatomaceous earth.
    - **Dinoflagellates:** Mostly marine and photosynthetic. They have two flagella. Some, like *Gonyaulax*, cause red tides.
    - **Euglenoids:** Freshwater organisms. They are photosynthetic in the presence of light but become heterotrophic in its absence (mixotrophic nutrition). Example: *Euglena*.
    - **Slime Moulds:** Saprophytic protists. They form an aggregation called a plasmodium under favorable conditions.
    - **Protozoans:** Heterotrophic protists, believed to be primitive relatives of animals. Groups include amoeboid, flagellated, ciliated, and sporozoans (*Plasmodium*, the malarial parasite).

### Kingdom Fungi
- **Characteristics:** Heterotrophic eukaryotes. Most are multicellular (except yeast). Cell wall is made of chitin. They are cosmopolitan.
- **Reproduction:**
    - **Asexual:** By spores (conidia, sporangiospores, zoospores).
    - **Sexual:** Involves three steps:
        1. **Plasmogamy:** Fusion of protoplasm.
        2. **Karyogamy:** Fusion of two nuclei.
        3. **Meiosis:** In the zygote, producing haploid spores.
    - **Dikaryophase:** An intervening stage in some fungi where a cell has two nuclei (n+n).
- **Groups:**
    - **Zygomycetes (Conjugation Fungi):** e.g., *Rhizopus* (bread mould).
    - **Ascomycetes (Sac Fungi):** e.g., *Penicillium*, *Aspergillus*, yeast.
    - **Basidiomycetes (Club Fungi):** e.g., Mushrooms, puffballs, rusts, smuts.
    - **Deuteromycetes (Imperfect Fungi):** Fungi in which the sexual stage is unknown. e.g., *Alternaria*, *Trichoderma*.
- **Economic Roles:** Decomposers, source of antibiotics (*Penicillium*), used in baking and brewing (yeast), cause diseases (rusts, smuts).
- **Lichens:** Symbiotic association between algae (phycobiont) and fungi (mycobiont).
- **Mycorrhiza:** Symbiotic association between fungi and the roots of higher plants.

## 3. Viruses, Viroids, and Prions
These are acellular and not included in the five-kingdom classification.
- **Viruses:**
    - **Characteristics:** Obligate intracellular parasites. They are inert outside a host cell. They consist of genetic material (DNA or RNA) enclosed in a protein coat (capsid).
    - **TMV (Tobacco Mosaic Virus):** A well-studied plant virus with RNA as its genetic material.
    - **Bacteriophage:** A virus that infects bacteria.
    - **Contributions:**
        - **D.J. Ivanowsky:** Discovered viruses.
        - **M.W. Beijerinck:** Called the infectious fluid "Contagium vivum fluidum".
        - **W.M. Stanley:** Crystallized viruses for the first time.
- **Viroids:** Infectious agents smaller than viruses, consisting of only a single strand of RNA without a protein coat. They cause plant diseases.
- **Prions:** Abnormally folded proteins that can transmit their misfolded shape onto normal variants of the same protein. They cause neurodegenerative diseases like Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) or "mad cow disease" and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans.
