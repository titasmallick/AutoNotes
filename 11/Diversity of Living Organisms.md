# Chapter 1: Diversity of Living Organisms

## (i) The Living World

### Need for Classification
*   **Organization:** To systematically study the vast number of organisms.
*   **Identification:** To accurately identify unknown organisms.
*   **Relationships:** To understand evolutionary relationships among organisms.
*   **Communication:** To establish a universal system for naming and describing organisms, avoiding ambiguity.
*   **Conservation:** To assess biodiversity and prioritize conservation efforts.

### Taxonomy & Systematics
*   **Taxonomy:** The branch of biology dealing with the classification, nomenclature, and identification of organisms.
*   **Systematics:** The study of the evolutionary relationships among organisms, including their classification, nomenclature, and identification. It is broader than taxonomy.
    *   **Numerical Taxonomy (Phenetics):** Based on all observable characteristics. Uses computers to analyze similarities and differences, assigning equal weight to each character.
    *   **Cytotaxonomy:** Based on cytological information like chromosome number, structure, and behavior.
    *   **Chemotaxonomy:** Uses chemical constituents of plants (e.g., amino acids, proteins, DNA sequences) to resolve taxonomic problems.

### Concept of Species and Taxonomical Hierarchy
*   **Species:** A group of individuals that can interbreed naturally to produce fertile offspring. It is the basic unit of classification.
*   **Taxonomical Hierarchy:** The arrangement of various taxa (groups) in a hierarchical order, from lower to higher categories.
    *   **Kingdom:** The highest category (e.g., Animalia, Plantae).
    *   **Phylum/Division:** (Phylum for animals, Division for plants) A group of related classes.
    *   **Class:** A group of related orders.
    *   **Order:** A group of related families.
    *   **Family:** A group of related genera.
    *   **Genus:** A group of related species.
    *   **Species:** The lowest obligate category.

### Binomial Nomenclature
*   **Definition:** A system of naming organisms where each organism is given a two-part name: the first part is the genus name, and the second part is the species epithet.
*   **Rules:**
    1.  Biological names are generally in Latin and written in italics.
    2.  The first word represents the genus, starting with a capital letter.
    3.  The second word is the species epithet, starting with a small letter.
    4.  When handwritten, both names are separately underlined; when typed, they are italicized.
    5.  The name of the author appears after the species epithet in an abbreviated form (e.g., *Mangifera indica* Linn.).
*   **Advantages:**
    *   **Universality:** Provides a unique and universally accepted name for each organism, avoiding confusion caused by local names.
    *   **Clarity:** Indicates the genus to which an organism belongs, showing its relationship with other species in the same genus.
    *   **Stability:** Names are stable and do not change frequently.

### Three Systems of Classification
*   **Artificial System:** Based on one or a few superficial morphological characters (e.g., habitat, color, number of stamens).
    *   **Example:** Linnaeus's system based on sexual characters of plants.
    *   **Limitations:** Does not reflect natural relationships or evolutionary history.
*   **Natural System:** Based on natural affinities among organisms, considering both external and internal features (e.g., anatomy, embryology, phytochemistry).
    *   **Example:** Bentham and Hooker's system for flowering plants.
    *   **Advantages:** Provides a more comprehensive and natural grouping.
*   **Phylogenetic System:** Based on evolutionary relationships among organisms. It assumes that organisms belonging to the same taxa have a common ancestor.
    *   **Example:** Engler and Prantl's system.
    *   **Advantages:** Reflects true evolutionary history and relationships.

## (ii) Biological Classification

    *   Pollen grains are carried by wind to the ovule.
    *   Fertilization occurs, and the zygote develops into an embryo.
    *   Ovules develop into naked seeds.
