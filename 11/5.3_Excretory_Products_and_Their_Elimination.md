# Chapter 5.3: Excretory Products and Their Elimination

## 1. Types of Excretion
- **Ammonotelism:** Excretion of ammonia. Highly toxic and requires large amounts of water for its elimination. Common in aquatic animals (e.g., bony fishes, aquatic amphibians, aquatic insects).
- **Ureotelism:** Excretion of urea. Less toxic than ammonia and requires less water. Common in mammals, terrestrial amphibians, and marine fishes.
- **Uricotelism:** Excretion of uric acid. Least toxic and requires minimal water. Common in reptiles, birds, land snails, and insects.

## 2. Human Excretory System
- **Organs:**
    - **Kidneys:** A pair of bean-shaped organs, located between the last thoracic and third lumbar vertebra, close to the dorsal inner wall of the abdominal cavity.
    - **Ureters:** A pair of thin muscular tubes emerging from each kidney, extending to the urinary bladder.
    - **Urinary Bladder:** A muscular sac that stores urine.
    - **Urethra:** A tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside.

### Kidney Structure
- **Outer Cortex:** Granular appearance.
- **Inner Medulla:** Divided into a few conical masses (medullary pyramids) projecting into the calyces.
- **Renal Pelvis:** A broad funnel-shaped space inner to the hilum, with projections called calyces.

### Nephron (Functional Unit of Kidney)
- Each kidney has nearly one million complex tubular structures called nephrons.
- **Components:**
    - **Glomerulus:** A tuft of capillaries formed by the afferent arteriole and drained by the efferent arteriole.
    - **Bowman's Capsule:** A double-walled cup-like structure enclosing the glomerulus. The glomerulus and Bowman's capsule together form the renal corpuscle or Malpighian body.
    - **Renal Tubule:**
        - **Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT):** Highly coiled segment next to Bowman's capsule.
        - **Henle's Loop:** A U-shaped segment, with a descending limb and an ascending limb.
        - **Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT):** Highly coiled segment after Henle's loop.
        - **Collecting Duct:** Many DCTs open into a straight collecting duct, which extends from the cortex to the inner parts of the medulla.

## 3. Urine Formation
Involves three main processes:

### a. Glomerular Filtration (Ultrafiltration)
- Occurs in the glomerulus.
- Blood is filtered through three layers: the endothelium of glomerular blood vessels, the epithelium of Bowman's capsule, and a basement membrane between these two layers.
- All components of blood plasma, except proteins, are filtered into the Bowman's capsule, forming the glomerular filtrate.
- **Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR):** The amount of filtrate formed by the kidneys per minute (approx. 125 ml/minute or 180 liters/day).

### b. Reabsorption (Selective Reabsorption)
- Nearly 99% of the filtrate is reabsorbed by the renal tubules.
- **PCT:** Most of the essential nutrients, 70-80% of electrolytes and water are reabsorbed.
- **Henle's Loop:** Plays a significant role in the maintenance of high osmolarity of medullary interstitial fluid. The descending limb is permeable to water but almost impermeable to electrolytes. The ascending limb is impermeable to water but permeable to electrolytes.
- **DCT:** Conditional reabsorption of Na⁺ and water takes place here.
- **Collecting Duct:** Reabsorbs a small amount of urea and water.

### c. Secretion (Tubular Secretion)
- Tubular cells secrete substances like H⁺, K⁺, and ammonia into the filtrate.
- This process helps in the maintenance of ionic and acid-base balance of body fluids.

## 4. Regulation of Kidney Function

### a. ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone) / Vasopressin
- Released from the posterior pituitary.
- Increases water reabsorption from the DCT and collecting duct, preventing diuresis (excessive urine production).
- Its secretion is stimulated by an increase in body fluid osmolarity or a decrease in blood volume.

### b. Renin-Angiotensin Mechanism
- A fall in glomerular blood flow/glomerular blood pressure/GFR activates the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) to release renin.
- Renin converts angiotensinogen (in blood) to angiotensin I, and then to angiotensin II.
- **Angiotensin II:**
    - A powerful vasoconstrictor, increasing glomerular blood pressure.
    - Stimulates the adrenal cortex to release aldosterone.
- **Aldosterone:** Increases reabsorption of Na⁺ and water from the DCT and collecting duct, leading to an increase in blood volume and pressure.

### c. ANF (Atrial Natriuretic Factor)
- Released by the atrial wall of the heart when blood pressure increases.
- Acts as a vasodilator, decreasing blood pressure.
- Inhibits renin release and aldosterone secretion.

### d. Erythropoietin
- A hormone secreted by the kidney (JGA cells) that stimulates erythropoiesis (formation of RBCs) in the bone marrow.

## 5. Disorders of the Excretory System
- **Uraemia:** Accumulation of urea in the blood due to kidney malfunction. Can lead to kidney failure.
- **Renal Failure (Kidney Failure):** Kidneys fail to perform their functions.
- **Dialysis (Artificial Kidney):** A process used to remove urea and other waste products from the blood in case of kidney failure. Blood is drained from a convenient artery, mixed with an anticoagulant, and passed through a dialysing unit (a coiled cellophane tube surrounded by dialysing fluid). The purified blood is then pumped back into the body through a vein.
- **Kidney Transplant:** The ultimate method in the correction of acute renal failures. A functioning kidney from a donor is transplanted into the patient.
