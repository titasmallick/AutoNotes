# Chapter 4: Plant Physiology

## (i) Photosynthesis

### Site of Photosynthesis
*   **Chloroplasts:** The primary site of photosynthesis in eukaryotic plant cells. They are green plastids containing chlorophyll pigments.
    *   **Thylakoids:** Flattened sacs within the chloroplasts, arranged in stacks called grana. Site of light-dependent reactions.
    *   **Stroma:** The fluid-filled space surrounding the thylakoids. Site of light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).

### Pigments Involved in Photosynthesis
*   **Chlorophylls:** Green pigments (e.g., Chlorophyll a, Chlorophyll b). Chlorophyll a is the primary photosynthetic pigment, directly involved in light reactions. Chlorophyll b and other accessory pigments absorb light energy and transfer it to chlorophyll a.
*   **Carotenoids:** Yellow, orange, or red pigments (e.g., Carotene, Xanthophyll). Act as accessory pigments, absorbing light at different wavelengths and protecting chlorophyll from photo-oxidation.

### Phases of Photosynthesis
*   **Light-Dependent Reactions (Light Reactions):**
    *   **Site:** Thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts.
    *   **Process:** Light energy is captured by photosynthetic pigments and converted into chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH.
    *   **Key events:**
        *   **Photolysis of water:** Water molecules are split, releasing electrons, protons (H+), and oxygen (O2).
        *   **Photophosphorylation:** Synthesis of ATP using light energy.
        *   **Reduction of NADP+:** NADP+ is reduced to NADPH.
*   **Light-Independent Reactions (Dark Reactions / Calvin Cycle / C3 Cycle):**
    *   **Site:** Stroma of chloroplasts.
    *   **Process:** ATP and NADPH (produced during light reactions) are used to fix carbon dioxide (CO2) and synthesize glucose.
    *   **Key events:**
        *   **Carboxylation:** CO2 is accepted by RuBP (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate), catalyzed by RuBisCO.
        *   **Reduction:** ATP and NADPH are used to convert 3-PGA (3-phosphoglycerate) into G3P (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate).
        *   **Regeneration:** RuBP is regenerated using ATP.

### Cyclic & Non-Cyclic Photophosphorylation
*   **Non-Cyclic Photophosphorylation (Z-scheme):**
    *   **Involves:** Both Photosystem I (PSI) and Photosystem II (PSII).
    *   **Electron flow:** Electrons released from water pass through PSII, electron transport chain, PSI, and finally reduce NADP+ to NADPH.
    *   **Products:** ATP, NADPH, and O2 (from water splitting).
    *   **Significance:** Produces both ATP and NADPH, which are essential for the Calvin cycle.
*   **Cyclic Photophosphorylation:**
    *   **Involves:** Only Photosystem I (PSI).
    *   **Electron flow:** Electrons from PSI are recycled back to PSI through an electron transport chain, generating only ATP.
    *   **Products:** Only ATP.
    *   **Significance:** Occurs when the cell needs more ATP than NADPH (e.g., to meet the higher ATP requirement for regeneration of RuBP in Calvin cycle).

### Chemiosmotic Hypothesis (by Peter Mitchell)
*   **Explanation:** Explains the mechanism of ATP synthesis in chloroplasts (and mitochondria).
*   **Key principle:** A proton gradient (H+ concentration gradient) is established across the thylakoid membrane (or inner mitochondrial membrane).
    *   **Proton accumulation:** Protons accumulate in the thylakoid lumen due to water splitting (inside lumen), proton pumping by electron transport chain (from stroma to lumen), and reduction of NADP+ (protons removed from stroma).
    *   **Proton motive force:** The proton gradient creates a proton motive force.
    *   **ATP synthase:** Protons flow back from the lumen to the stroma through the ATP synthase complex (Fo-F1 particles), which drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP and Pi.

### Photorespiration
*   **Definition:** A wasteful process that occurs in C3 plants when RuBisCO (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) binds with O2 instead of CO2.
*   **Process:** RuBisCO acts as an oxygenase, leading to the formation of one molecule of 3-PGA and one molecule of phosphoglycolate. Phosphoglycolate is then metabolized, releasing CO2 and consuming ATP and NADPH, without producing sugars.
*   **Conditions:** Occurs under high O2 concentration, high temperature, and high light intensity.
*   **Significance:** Reduces photosynthetic efficiency in C3 plants.

### C3 and C4 Pathways
*   **C3 Pathway (Calvin Cycle):**
    *   **First stable product:** A 3-carbon compound, 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3-PGA).
    *   **Primary CO2 acceptor:** RuBP.
    *   **Enzyme:** RuBisCO.
    *   **Plants:** Most plants (e.g., Wheat, Rice, Potato).
    *   **Photorespiration:** High.
*   **C4 Pathway (Hatch-Slack Pathway):**
    *   **First stable product:** A 4-carbon compound, oxaloacetic acid (OAA).
    *   **Primary CO2 acceptor:** PEP (phosphoenolpyruvate).
    *   **Enzyme:** PEP carboxylase (PEPCase) in mesophyll cells.
    *   **Plants:** Adapted to hot, dry regions (e.g., Maize, Sugarcane, Sorghum).
    *   **Photorespiration:** Negligible, due to efficient CO2 pumping into bundle sheath cells.

### Kranz Anatomy
*   **Definition:** A specialized leaf anatomy found in C4 plants.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Bundle Sheath Cells:** Large cells surrounding the vascular bundles, forming a wreath-like (Kranz) arrangement. They have thick walls, no intercellular spaces, and contain many chloroplasts.
    *   **Mesophyll Cells:** Located between the bundle sheath and epidermis. They have smaller chloroplasts.
*   **Function:** The C4 pathway spatially separates CO2 fixation (in mesophyll cells) from the Calvin cycle (in bundle sheath cells), allowing for efficient CO2 concentration around RuBisCO and minimizing photorespiration.

### Factors Affecting Photosynthesis
*   **Light:** Light intensity, quality, and duration.
*   **Carbon Dioxide Concentration:** Limiting factor at low concentrations.
*   **Temperature:** Affects enzyme activity.
*   **Water:** Essential reactant, but its direct effect is less significant than its indirect effect on stomatal opening.
*   **Mineral Elements:** Required for chlorophyll synthesis and enzyme activity.
*   **Blackman's Law of Limiting Factors (1905):** When a process is conditioned as to its rapidity by a number of separate factors, the rate of the process is limited by the pace of the slowest factor. In photosynthesis, if one factor is in short supply, it will limit the rate of the entire process, even if other factors are optimal.

## (ii) Respiration

### Types of Respiration
*   **Aerobic Respiration:**
    *   **Definition:** Complete oxidation of organic substances (glucose) in the presence of oxygen, releasing a large amount of energy.
    *   **Overall equation:** C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + Energy (ATP)
    *   **Stages:** Glycolysis, Krebs cycle (TCA cycle), Electron Transport System (ETS).
    *   **Site:** Cytoplasm (glycolysis) and Mitochondria (Krebs cycle, ETS).
*   **Anaerobic Respiration:**
    *   **Definition:** Incomplete oxidation of organic substances in the absence of oxygen, releasing a smaller amount of energy.
    *   **Products:** Alcohol (in yeast) or Lactic acid (in muscle cells).
    *   **Stages:** Glycolysis, followed by fermentation.
    *   **Site:** Cytoplasm.

### Glycolysis (EMP Pathway)
*   **Definition:** The breakdown of glucose (6-carbon) into two molecules of pyruvate (3-carbon).
*   **Site:** Cytoplasm.
*   **Oxygen requirement:** Occurs in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions (does not require oxygen).
*   **Net gain:** 2 ATP (by substrate-level phosphorylation) and 2 NADH.

### TCA Cycle (Krebs Cycle / Citric Acid Cycle)
*   **Definition:** A series of biochemical reactions that oxidize acetyl-CoA (derived from pyruvate) to CO2, generating ATP, NADH, and FADH2.
*   **Site:** Mitochondrial matrix.
*   **Oxygen requirement:** Aerobic process.
*   **Products per glucose molecule (2 acetyl-CoA):** 6 NADH, 2 FADH2, 2 ATP (or GTP), 4 CO2.

### ETS (Electron Transport System) and Oxidative Phosphorylation
*   **ETS:**
    *   **Definition:** A series of electron carriers located on the inner mitochondrial membrane.
    *   **Process:** Electrons from NADH and FADH2 (produced during glycolysis and Krebs cycle) are passed down the electron transport chain, releasing energy.
    *   **Final electron acceptor:** Oxygen.
*   **Oxidative Phosphorylation:**
    *   **Definition:** The process of ATP synthesis using the energy released from the transfer of electrons in the ETS.
    *   **Mechanism:** Similar to chemiosmotic hypothesis in photosynthesis. Proton gradient is established across the inner mitochondrial membrane, and protons flow back through ATP synthase, driving ATP synthesis.
*   **Total ATP yield from aerobic respiration:** Approximately 36-38 ATP molecules per glucose molecule.

### Respiratory Quotient (RQ)
*   **Definition:** The ratio of the volume of CO2 evolved to the volume of O2 consumed during respiration.
*   **Formula:** RQ = Volume of CO2 evolved / Volume of O2 consumed
*   **Significance:** Indicates the type of respiratory substrate being oxidized.
    *   **Carbohydrates:** RQ = 1 (e.g., C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O; RQ = 6/6 = 1)
    *   **Fats:** RQ < 1 (e.g., for tripalmitin, RQ = 0.7)
    *   **Proteins:** RQ ≈ 0.9
    *   **Organic acids:** RQ > 1
    *   **Anaerobic respiration:** RQ = ∞ (infinite) as O2 consumed is zero.

## (iii) Plant Growth and Development

### Germination
*   **Definition:** The process by which a seed embryo develops into a seedling.
*   **Types of Germination:**
    *   **Hypogeal Germination:** Cotyledons remain below the soil surface. The epicotyl elongates, pushing the plumule above ground (e.g., Pea, Maize, Rice).
    *   **Epigeal Germination:** Cotyledons are pushed above the soil surface due to the elongation of the hypocotyl (e.g., Bean, Castor, Sunflower).
    *   **Vivipary:** Germination of seeds while still attached to the parent plant, especially in mangroves (e.g., *Rhizophora*, *Sonneratia*).

### Differentiation, De-differentiation, and Re-differentiation
*   **Differentiation:** The process by which cells, tissues, and organs undergo changes in structure and function to become specialized (e.g., meristematic cells differentiating into xylem or phloem).
*   **De-differentiation:** The process by which differentiated cells regain the capacity to divide (e.g., mature parenchyma cells forming callus in tissue culture).
*   **Re-differentiation:** The process by which de-differentiated cells again lose the capacity to divide and become specialized to perform specific functions (e.g., cells in callus differentiating into xylem and phloem).

### Growth Phases & Rate
*   **Phases of Growth:**
    *   **Lag Phase:** Initial slow growth.
    *   **Log/Exponential Phase:** Rapid, exponential growth.
    *   **Stationary Phase:** Growth rate slows down as resources become limiting.
    *   **Declining/Senescent Phase:** Negative growth, leading to death.
*   **Growth Rate:** The increase in growth per unit time.
    *   **Arithmetic Growth:** Rate of growth is constant, and a plot of length/weight against time yields a linear curve (e.g., root elongation).
    *   **Geometric Growth:** Initial slow growth followed by rapid exponential growth. A plot of length/weight against time yields a sigmoid (S-shaped) curve (e.g., growth of a plant or population).
