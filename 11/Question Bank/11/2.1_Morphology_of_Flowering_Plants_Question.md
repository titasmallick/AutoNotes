## Section D: Long Answer Questions (3 marks each)

1.  Flowering plants have two main types of root systems: the tap root system and the fibrous root system. The tap root system, found in dicots like mustard, consists of a main primary root that grows deep into the soil and gives rise to lateral roots. The fibrous root system, found in monocots like wheat, consists of a cluster of roots of similar size that arise from the base of the stem.
2.  Roots are modified for storage by becoming fleshy and swollen with stored food. Tap roots can be modified into conical (carrot), fusiform (radish), or napiform (turnip) shapes. Adventitious roots can also be modified for storage, as seen in the tuberous roots of sweet potato. These storage roots are significant as they provide food for the plant during unfavorable conditions and are also a major food source for humans.
3.  Roots are modified for support in various ways. Prop roots, as seen in the Banyan tree, are adventitious roots that grow from the branches and provide support to the heavy branches. Stilt roots, as seen in maize and sugarcane, are adventitious roots that grow from the lower nodes of the stem and provide additional support to the plant. These modifications are crucial for the stability of the plant.
4.  In plants growing in swampy areas where the soil is waterlogged and lacks oxygen, the roots are modified for respiration. These plants, such as *Rhizophora* (mangroves), develop specialized roots called pneumatophores that grow vertically upwards from the soil and have pores (lenticels) to take in atmospheric oxygen for respiration.
5.  A tap root system has a main primary root with lateral branches and is found in dicots, while a fibrous root system has a cluster of roots of similar size and is found in monocots. Tap roots grow deep into the soil, providing strong anchorage, while fibrous roots are shallow and help in preventing soil erosion. Tap roots are advantageous in dry areas, while fibrous roots are advantageous in absorbing surface water.
6.  Adventitious roots are roots that arise from any part of the plant other than the radicle. They are important for vegetative propagation in many plants. For example, in Bryophyllum, adventitious roots arise from the leaf margins and develop into new plants. In sweet potato, adventitious roots are modified for food storage and can be used for propagation.
7.  Tap roots can be modified for food storage in various ways. Conical roots are broad at the base and taper towards the apex, as in carrots. Fusiform roots are swollen in the middle and taper at both ends, as in radishes. Napiform roots are spherical at the base and taper sharply at the apex, as in turnips.
8.  Prop roots and stilt roots are both adventitious roots that provide support to the plant. Prop roots grow from the branches of large trees like the Banyan and hang downwards to provide support. Stilt roots grow from the lower nodes of the stem in plants like maize and sugarcane and provide support to the weak stem.
9.  Pneumatophores are specialized respiratory roots found in mangrove plants like *Rhizophora* that grow in swampy, saline environments. These roots grow vertically upwards from the soil and have numerous pores called lenticels on their surface, which allow for the exchange of gases, enabling the plant to respire in the oxygen-deficient soil.
10. Different root modifications have significant adaptive value for plant survival. Storage roots help plants to survive during unfavorable conditions. Supporting roots provide stability to the plant. Respiratory roots enable plants to survive in waterlogged soils. These adaptations allow plants to thrive in diverse and challenging environments.
11. Root modifications are crucial for plants to adapt to different environmental conditions. In arid regions, plants have deep tap roots to access water from deep within the soil. In swampy areas, plants have pneumatophores for respiration. In nutrient-poor soils, some plants have mycorrhizal associations with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption.
12. Various root modifications have great economic importance. Storage roots like carrots, radishes, and sweet potatoes are major food sources. Some roots have medicinal properties. Roots of some plants are used for timber and other commercial purposes.
13. The type of root system is often related to the plant's habitat. Plants in dry areas often have deep tap root systems to reach groundwater. Plants in areas with abundant surface water often have fibrous root systems. The root system is a key adaptation to the water availability in the habitat.
14. Root modifications play a significant role in vegetative propagation. Tuberous roots of sweet potato and Dahlia can be used to grow new plants. In some plants, roots develop adventitious buds that can grow into new shoots. This is a common method of asexual reproduction in many plant species.
15. The structure of a plant's root system is related to its nutritional requirements. Plants with extensive fibrous root systems are efficient at absorbing nutrients from the surface soil. Plants with deep tap roots can access nutrients from deeper soil layers. The root system's architecture is optimized for nutrient uptake from the specific soil environment.
16. Stems are modified for storage of food in various ways. Underground stems like the tuber of a potato, the rhizome of ginger, the bulb of an onion, and the corm of a colocasia are all examples of stem modifications for food storage. These stored food reserves are used by the plant during unfavorable conditions and for vegetative propagation.
17. Underground stems can be modified in several ways. Tubers (potato) are swollen stem tips with buds. Rhizomes (ginger) are horizontal stems with nodes and internodes. Bulbs (onion) have a reduced stem with fleshy leaves. Corms (colocasia) are condensed, solid stems. These modifications primarily serve for food storage and perennation.
18. Stems can be modified for support by developing into tendrils. Stem tendrils are slender, coiling structures that help the plant to climb. They develop from axillary buds, as seen in gourds and grapevines. This modification allows the plant to get better access to sunlight.
19. Stems can be modified for protection by developing into thorns. Thorns are hard, pointed structures that are modified axillary buds. They protect the plant from being eaten by animals. Examples of plants with thorns include *Citrus* and *Bougainvillea*.
20. In arid plants, stems are often modified to become photosynthetic to reduce water loss from leaves. These stems can be flattened, as in *Opuntia*, or fleshy and cylindrical, as in *Euphorbia*. They contain chlorophyll and carry out photosynthesis, while the leaves are reduced to spines.
21. Stem modifications are important for vegetative propagation. Underground stems like potatoes and ginger can be used to grow new plants from their buds. Runners, stolons, and offsets are other stem modifications that help in the vegetative propagation and spread of the plant.
22. Tubers, rhizomes, bulbs, and corms are all underground stem modifications for storage. Tubers are swollen stem tips, rhizomes are horizontal stems, bulbs have fleshy leaves, and corms are condensed, solid stems. They differ in their structure and the part of the stem that is modified.
23. Stem tendrils are modified axillary buds that are sensitive to contact and coil around a support to help the plant climb. They are found in plants like gourds and grapevines. The coiling mechanism is a thigmotropic response.
24. Thorns are modified axillary buds that develop into hard, pointed structures. They provide protection to the plant against herbivores. They are found in plants like *Citrus* and *Bougainvillea*.
25. Photosynthetic stems are a crucial adaptation for desert plants. By reducing their leaves to spines, these plants minimize water loss through transpiration. The flattened or cylindrical stems take over the function of photosynthesis, allowing the plant to survive in arid conditions.
26. Stem modifications are key adaptations for survival in different environments. In deserts, photosynthetic stems conserve water. In temperate regions, underground storage stems help plants to survive the winter. Climbing stems help plants to compete for sunlight in dense forests.
27. Stem modifications have great economic importance. Potatoes (tubers) and ginger (rhizomes) are major food crops. Sugarcane stems are a source of sugar. Stems of many plants are used for timber, paper, and other products.
28. Stem modifications and leaf modifications can serve similar functions, such as support (tendrils) and protection (thorns and spines). However, they differ in their origin. Stem tendrils and thorns are modified stems, while leaf tendrils and spines are modified leaves.
29. Runners and offsets are both subaerial stem modifications for vegetative propagation. Runners are long, slender stems that grow along the ground, while offsets are shorter and thicker and are typically found in aquatic plants. Both produce new plants at their nodes.
30. Stem modifications contribute to plant survival in various ways. They can provide support, protection, and a means of vegetative propagation. They can also be adapted for photosynthesis and food storage. These modifications are crucial for the plant's ability to thrive in its environment.
31. Leaves can be simple or compound. A simple leaf has a single, undivided lamina, while a compound leaf has a lamina that is divided into multiple leaflets. Compound leaves can be pinnately compound (leaflets on a rachis) or palmately compound (leaflets from a single point).
32. Phyllotaxy is the arrangement of leaves on a stem. There are three main types: alternate (one leaf per node), opposite (two leaves per node), and whorled (more than two leaves per node). This arrangement is crucial for optimizing light capture for photosynthesis.
33. Leaves can be modified in various ways. They can be modified into tendrils for climbing (peas), spines for protection (cacti), or fleshy leaves for storage (onion). Some leaves are modified to trap insects (pitcher plant).
34. Compound leaves have a lamina that is divided into leaflets. In pinnately compound leaves, like in neem, the leaflets are arranged on a common axis called the rachis. In palmately compound leaves, like in silk cotton, the leaflets are attached at a common point at the tip of the petiole.
35. Leaves can be modified into tendrils for climbing. These are slender, coiling structures that are sensitive to touch and help the plant to attach to a support. An example is the pea plant, where the upper leaflets are modified into tendrils.
36. Leaves can be modified into spines for defense. These are sharp, pointed structures that protect the plant from herbivores. An example is the cactus, where the leaves are reduced to spines to also conserve water.
37. Leaves can be modified for storage by becoming fleshy and storing food and water. The fleshy leaves of onion and garlic are examples of storage leaves. These stored reserves are used by the plant during unfavorable conditions.
38. Insectivorous leaves are modified to trap and digest insects. This is an adaptation for plants growing in nutrient-poor soils. The pitcher plant has pitcher-shaped leaves to trap insects, and the Venus flytrap has leaves that can snap shut to catch prey.
39. A simple leaf has a single lamina, while a compound leaf has a lamina divided into leaflets. Simple leaves are directly attached to the stem, while compound leaves have a petiole and a rachis with leaflets. Both types of leaves are involved in photosynthesis.
40. The different types of phyllotaxy (alternate, opposite, and whorled) are adaptations to maximize the exposure of leaves to sunlight and minimize shading of lower leaves by upper leaves. This arrangement is crucial for efficient photosynthesis.
41. Leaf modifications are key adaptations to different environmental conditions. In deserts, leaves are reduced to spines to conserve water. In nutrient-poor soils, leaves are modified to trap insects. In dense forests, leaves are modified into tendrils for climbing to reach sunlight.
42. The structure of a leaf is closely related to its photosynthetic efficiency. A broad, flat lamina maximizes the surface area for light absorption. The presence of stomata allows for gas exchange. The arrangement of leaves on the stem (phyllotaxy) also affects the overall photosynthetic efficiency of the plant.
43. Leaf modifications have economic importance. The leaves of many plants, such as spinach and lettuce, are used as food. The leaves of some plants have medicinal properties. The leaves of the tea plant are used to make a popular beverage.
44. Leaf modifications are crucial for plant survival. They can provide support, protection, and a means of obtaining nutrients. They are also important for water conservation. These adaptations allow plants to thrive in a wide range of habitats.
45. Leaf tendrils and stem tendrils both help in climbing, but they differ in their origin. Leaf tendrils are modified leaves or parts of a leaf, as in peas. Stem tendrils are modified stems, as in gourds.
46. Inflorescence is the arrangement of flowers on a floral axis. There are two main types: racemose and cymose. In racemose inflorescence, the main axis has indeterminate growth, and flowers are arranged in an acropetal manner. In cymose inflorescence, the main axis has determinate growth, and flowers are arranged in a basipetal manner.
47. Racemose inflorescence has an main axis that continues to grow, with flowers developing in an acropetal succession (younger flowers at the apex). This type of inflorescence allows for the production of a large number of flowers over a longer period. Examples include radish and mustard.
48. Cymose inflorescence has a main axis that terminates in a flower, and further growth is by lateral branches that also terminate in flowers. The flowers are arranged in a basipetal succession (older flower at the apex). This results in a more compact inflorescence. Examples include jasmine and *Calotropis*.
49. Racemose and cymose inflorescences differ in their growth pattern and flower arrangement. Racemose has indeterminate growth and acropetal succession, while cymose has determinate growth and basipetal succession. Racemose inflorescences are generally elongated, while cymose inflorescences are more compact.
50. Inflorescence plays a significant role in plant reproduction by making the flowers more conspicuous to pollinators. The clustering of flowers in an inflorescence increases the chances of pollination. It also allows for the efficient pollination of a large number of flowers at once.
51. Flowers in an inflorescence can be arranged in various patterns. In racemose inflorescences, the arrangement is acropetal. In cymose inflorescences, the arrangement is basipetal. There are also specialized types of inflorescences like the cyathium in *Euphorbia* and the capitulum in sunflowers.
52. The structure of an inflorescence can affect pollination efficiency. A large, conspicuous inflorescence can attract more pollinators from a distance. The arrangement of flowers can also facilitate the movement of pollinators between flowers, leading to more efficient pollen transfer.
53. The evolution of the inflorescence is considered a key innovation in flowering plants. It has allowed for the diversification of pollination strategies and has contributed to the reproductive success of angiosperms. The inflorescence has evolved in response to selection pressures from pollinators and the environment.
54. The type of inflorescence is often related to the pollination mechanism. For example, wind-pollinated plants often have long, pendulous inflorescences (catkins) that facilitate the release and capture of pollen. Insect-pollinated plants often have conspicuous inflorescences that attract pollinators.
55. Different types of inflorescences have adaptive advantages. Racemose inflorescences can produce flowers over a long period, increasing the chances of pollination. Cymose inflorescences are often more compact and can be advantageous in certain habitats. The diversity of inflorescence types reflects the diversity of pollination strategies in flowering plants.
56. A typical flower consists of four whorls of modified leaves attached to a receptacle. The outermost whorl is the calyx (sepals), which protects the bud. The next whorl is the corolla (petals), which attracts pollinators. The androecium (stamens) is the male reproductive part, and the gynoecium (carpels) is the female reproductive part.
57. Flower symmetry can be radial (actinomorphic) or bilateral (zygomorphic). Actinomorphic flowers can be divided into equal halves in any plane, while zygomorphic flowers can be divided into equal halves in only one plane. Flower symmetry is important for attracting specific pollinators and ensuring efficient pollen transfer.
58. Aestivation is the arrangement of sepals or petals in a floral bud. The main types are valvate (margins touch), twisted (margins overlap regularly), imbricate (margins overlap irregularly), and vexillary (specialized arrangement in pea flowers). Aestivation protects the inner parts of the flower in the bud stage.
59. The androecium is the male reproductive part of a flower, consisting of stamens. Each stamen has a filament and an anther. The anther produces pollen grains, which contain the male gametes. The arrangement and number of stamens are important taxonomic characters.
60. The gynoecium is the female reproductive part of a flower, consisting of one or more carpels. Each carpel has a stigma, style, and ovary. The ovary contains the ovules, which develop into seeds after fertilization. The gynoecium is the site of fertilization and fruit development.
61. Placentation is the arrangement of ovules within the ovary. The main types are marginal (pea), axile (tomato), parietal (mustard), free central (*Dianthus*), and basal (sunflower). The type of placentation is an important character for plant classification.
62. Actinomorphic flowers have radial symmetry and are considered to be more primitive, while zygomorphic flowers have bilateral symmetry and are considered to be more advanced. Zygomorphic flowers are often associated with specialized pollinators. Examples of actinomorphic flowers include mustard and *Datura*, while examples of zygomorphic flowers include pea and gulmohar.
63. The accessory whorls of a flower are the calyx and the corolla. The calyx (sepals) is the outermost whorl and protects the flower in the bud stage. The corolla (petals) is the next whorl and is usually brightly colored to attract pollinators.
64. The reproductive whorls of a flower are the androecium and the gynoecium. The androecium (stamens) is the male reproductive part and produces pollen. The gynoecium (carpels) is the female reproductive part and contains the ovules. These whorls are essential for sexual reproduction.
65. The different types of aestivation (valvate, twisted, imbricate, vexillary) describe the arrangement of sepals and petals in the bud. This arrangement is crucial for protecting the delicate reproductive parts of the flower from desiccation and mechanical injury before the flower opens.
66. A stamen consists of a filament and an anther. The anther contains pollen sacs where pollen grains are produced. A carpel consists of a stigma, style, and ovary. The stigma is the receptive surface for pollen, the style connects the stigma to the ovary, and the ovary contains the ovules.
67. In marginal placentation, the ovules are arranged in two rows along the ventral suture of a simple ovary, as seen in the pea pod. This type of placentation is characteristic of the legume family.
68. In axile placentation, the ovules are arranged on the central axis of a compound ovary with multiple locules, as seen in tomato and lemon. This is a common type of placentation in many flowering plants.
69. In parietal placentation, the ovules are attached to the inner wall of a compound ovary, as seen in mustard and *Argemone*. The ovary is unilocular, but it may become bilocular due to the formation of a false septum.
70. In free central placentation, the ovules are borne on a central axis in a unilocular ovary, without any septa, as seen in *Dianthus* and *Primrose*. In basal placentation, a single ovule is attached to the base of a unilocular ovary, as seen in sunflower and marigold.
71. The structure of a flower is closely related to its pollination mechanism. For example, flowers pollinated by insects are often brightly colored and have nectar, while flowers pollinated by wind are often small, inconspicuous, and produce large amounts of pollen.
72. Flower symmetry influences pollinator attraction and efficiency. Zygomorphic flowers often have a landing platform for insects and guide them to the nectar and reproductive parts, ensuring more precise pollen transfer. Actinomorphic flowers are more generalist in their pollination.
73. The aestivation of sepals and petals in the bud provides a protective covering for the developing reproductive parts of the flower. The overlapping arrangement of sepals and petals in imbricate and twisted aestivation provides better protection than the valvate arrangement.
74. The type of placentation determines the arrangement of ovules and, consequently, the number and arrangement of seeds in the fruit. This can affect seed size, competition among developing seeds, and the mechanism of seed dispersal.

88. Plants in saline environments have structural modifications to tolerate high salt concentrations. They can have succulent leaves and stems to store water, and they can have salt glands to excrete excess salt. These adaptations are essential for survival in saline habitats.
89. Morphological diversity is the basis for plant identification and classification. Taxonomists use morphological characters, such as the structure of flowers, leaves, and fruits, to identify and classify plants. Understanding plant morphology is fundamental to the study of plant systematics.
90. Plants have various morphological adaptations for water conservation, especially in arid environments. They can have succulent leaves and stems to store water, a thick waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and sunken stomata to minimize transpiration. These adaptations are crucial for survival in dry habitats.
91. The type of root system is related to a plant's life cycle strategy. Annual plants often have shallow, fibrous root systems that can quickly absorb surface water. Perennial plants often have deep tap root systems that can access water from deeper soil layers and store food for survival during unfavorable seasons.
92. Stem modifications are crucial for plant survival and reproduction. Underground storage stems allow plants to survive harsh conditions and reproduce vegetatively. Climbing stems help plants to reach sunlight. Photosynthetic stems are an adaptation to arid environments.
