## Section C: Short Answer Questions (2 marks each) - Answers

1.  **Describe the composition of blood plasma.**
    *   Blood plasma is a straw-colored, viscous fluid constituting nearly 55% of the blood. It contains 90-92% water and 6-8% proteins like fibrinogen, globulins, and albumins. It also carries minerals, glucose, amino acids, lipids, and other essential substances.
2.  **Explain the structure and function of RBCs.**
    *   RBCs (Erythrocytes) are biconcave, anucleated cells in mammals, containing hemoglobin. Their biconcave shape increases surface area for efficient gas exchange and allows easy passage through capillaries. Their primary function is to transport oxygen from the lungs to tissues and a small amount of carbon dioxide back to the lungs.
3.  **Differentiate between granulocytes and agranulocytes.**
    *   Granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils) are WBCs characterized by the presence of distinct granules in their cytoplasm and lobed nuclei. Agranulocytes (lymphocytes, monocytes) lack prominent cytoplasmic granules and have a single, unlobed nucleus.
4.  **Describe the functions of different types of WBCs.**
    *   **Neutrophils:** Phagocytic, engulfing bacteria and cellular debris.
    *   **Eosinophils:** Involved in allergic reactions and defense against parasitic infections.
    *   **Basophils:** Secrete histamine, serotonin, and heparin, playing a role in inflammatory responses.
    *   **Monocytes:** Phagocytic, differentiating into macrophages in tissues.
    *   **Lymphocytes:** B and T lymphocytes are crucial for specific immune responses.
5.  **Explain the role of platelets in blood clotting.**
    *   Platelets (thrombocytes) are cell fragments that play a crucial role in hemostasis. Upon injury to a blood vessel, platelets aggregate at the site of injury, forming a platelet plug. They also release factors that initiate the cascade of reactions leading to the formation of a stable fibrin clot, preventing excessive blood loss.
6.  **Describe the ABO blood group system.**
    *   The ABO blood group system is based on the presence or absence of two surface antigens, A and B, on the red blood cells. Individuals with antigen A have anti-B antibodies, those with antigen B have anti-A antibodies, AB blood group has both antigens and no antibodies, and O blood group has neither antigen but both anti-A and anti-B antibodies.
7.  **Explain Rh incompatibility and its consequences.**
    *   Rh incompatibility occurs when an Rh-negative mother carries an Rh-positive fetus. During delivery, fetal Rh antigens can enter the mother's bloodstream, causing her to produce anti-Rh antibodies. In subsequent Rh-positive pregnancies, these maternal antibodies can cross the placenta and destroy fetal RBCs, leading to erythroblastosis foetalis (severe anemia and jaundice in the newborn).
8.  **Describe the process of blood coagulation.**
    *   Blood coagulation is a cascade of enzymatic reactions. Injury to blood vessels stimulates platelets to release factors. These factors, along with calcium ions, activate prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then converts soluble fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin threads. These fibrin threads form a meshwork that traps formed elements, creating a blood clot.
9.  **Explain the formation and functions of lymph.**
    *   Lymph (tissue fluid) is formed when water and small soluble substances from blood plasma filter out of capillaries into the intercellular spaces. It is a colorless fluid containing specialized lymphocytes. Its functions include transporting nutrients and oxygen to cells, removing metabolic wastes, absorbing fatty acids and glycerol through lacteals, and playing a vital role in the body's immune responses.
10. **Describe the location and structure of the human heart.**
    *   The human heart is located in the thoracic cavity, between the two lungs, slightly tilted to the left. It is protected by a double-walled membranous sac called the pericardium, which encloses pericardial fluid. The heart has four chambers: two upper, smaller atria (right and left) and two lower, larger ventricles (right and left).
11. **Explain the different valves of the heart and their functions.**
    *   The heart has four valves that ensure unidirectional blood flow. The tricuspid valve is between the right atrium and right ventricle. The bicuspid (mitral) valve is between the left atrium and left ventricle. These AV valves prevent backflow into the atria during ventricular contraction. Semilunar valves are located at the exits of the ventricles into the pulmonary artery and aorta, preventing backflow into the ventricles during diastole.
12. **Describe the phases of the cardiac cycle.**
    *   The cardiac cycle is the sequence of events in one heartbeat, lasting approximately 0.8 seconds. It begins with **joint diastole**, where all chambers are relaxed and blood fills the atria and partially the ventricles. Then, **atrial systole** occurs, pushing remaining blood into the ventricles. This is followed by **ventricular systole**, where ventricles contract, closing AV valves (lub sound) and opening semilunar valves to pump blood into arteries. Finally, **ventricular diastole** occurs, ventricles relax, closing semilunar valves (dub sound).
13. **Explain the heart sounds and their causes.**
    *   There are two main heart sounds, "lub" and "dub," produced during the cardiac cycle. The first heart sound, "lub," is produced by the closure of the atrioventricular (AV) valves (tricuspid and bicuspid) at the beginning of ventricular systole, preventing blood backflow into the atria. The second heart sound, "dub," is produced by the closure of the semilunar valves (aortic and pulmonary) at the beginning of ventricular diastole, preventing backflow from the arteries into the ventricles.
14. **Describe the waves of an ECG and their significance.**
    *   An ECG (Electrocardiograph) records the electrical activity of the heart. The **P-wave** represents atrial depolarization (contraction), indicating the electrical impulse originating from the SA node and spreading through the atria. The **QRS complex** (the largest wave) represents ventricular depolarization (contraction), showing the rapid spread of electrical impulse through the ventricles. The **T-wave** represents ventricular repolarization (relaxation), indicating the electrical recovery of the ventricles.
15. **Explain double circulation in humans.**
    *   Double circulation means that blood passes through the heart twice to complete one full circuit of the body. It involves two distinct pathways: pulmonary circulation and systemic circulation. This ensures that oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept separate, allowing for efficient oxygen delivery to tissues and removal of carbon dioxide.
16. **Differentiate between pulmonary and systemic circulation.**
    *   **Pulmonary circulation** involves the pathway of deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs for oxygenation, and then the return of oxygenated blood to the left atrium. Its purpose is gas exchange. **Systemic circulation** involves the pathway of oxygenated blood from the left ventricle to all body parts (except lungs) to deliver oxygen and nutrients, and then the return of deoxygenated blood to the right atrium. Its purpose is to supply the body with oxygenated blood.
17. **Describe blood pressure and its measurement.**
    *   Blood pressure is the force exerted by circulating blood against the walls of blood vessels. It is measured as two values: **systolic pressure** (pressure during ventricular contraction, approx. 120 mmHg) and **diastolic pressure** (pressure during ventricular relaxation, approx. 80 mmHg). It is typically measured using a sphygmomanometer and a stethoscope, expressed as systolic over diastolic (e.g., 120/80 mmHg).
18. **Explain hypertension and its effects.**
    *   Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is diagnosed when blood pressure consistently exceeds 140/90 mmHg. It is a silent killer as it often has no symptoms but can lead to serious health problems. Prolonged hypertension can damage blood vessels, increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, and other cardiovascular complications.
19. **Describe coronary artery disease and its causes.**
    *   Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) affects the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart muscle itself. It is primarily caused by atherosclerosis, which is the deposition of calcium, fat, cholesterol, and fibrous tissues in the coronary arteries. This buildup narrows the arteries, reducing blood flow to the heart muscle and potentially leading to angina or heart attack.
20. **Explain the difference between angina and heart attack.**
    *   **Angina pectoris** is acute chest pain that occurs when the heart muscle does not receive enough oxygen, usually due to narrowed coronary arteries. It is a symptom of CAD and typically subsides with rest or medication. A **heart attack** (myocardial infarction) occurs when a part of the heart muscle is suddenly damaged or dies due to a complete blockage of blood supply, usually by a blood clot in a coronary artery. It is a more severe and often life-threatening event.
21. **Describe the functions of blood in the human body.**
    *   Blood performs several vital functions. It transports oxygen from the lungs to tissues and carbon dioxide from tissues to the lungs. It also transports nutrients, hormones, and waste products. Blood plays a crucial role in immunity through its WBCs, in blood clotting via platelets and clotting factors, and in maintaining body temperature and pH balance.
22. **Explain how RBCs are adapted for oxygen transport.**
    *   RBCs are highly adapted for oxygen transport. Their biconcave shape increases their surface area-to-volume ratio, facilitating rapid gas diffusion. They are anucleated, allowing more space for hemoglobin. Hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein, reversibly binds to oxygen, enabling efficient loading in the lungs and unloading in the tissues.
23. **Describe the immune functions of WBCs.**
    *   WBCs (leucocytes) are the primary components of the body's immune system. Neutrophils and monocytes are phagocytic, engulfing pathogens. Eosinophils combat parasitic infections and modulate allergic reactions. Basophils release inflammatory mediators. Lymphocytes (B and T cells) provide specific immunity, recognizing and targeting specific pathogens or abnormal cells.
24. **Explain the mechanism of blood clot formation.**
    *   Blood clot formation (coagulation) is a complex process initiated by injury to a blood vessel. Platelets adhere to the injured site and release factors. These factors, along with calcium ions, activate a cascade of clotting factors, leading to the conversion of inactive prothrombin to active thrombin. Thrombin then catalyzes the conversion of soluble fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin threads, which form a meshwork to trap blood cells and form a stable clot.
25. **Describe the lymphatic system and its functions.**
    *   The lymphatic system is a network of vessels, tissues, and organs that work alongside the circulatory system. It collects excess tissue fluid (lymph) and returns it to the bloodstream, maintaining fluid balance. It also plays a crucial role in immunity by filtering lymph through lymph nodes, where lymphocytes mount immune responses against pathogens. Additionally, lacteals in the small intestine absorb dietary fats into the lymphatic system.
26. **Explain the electrical conduction system of the heart.**
    *   The heart's electrical conduction system initiates and coordinates the heartbeat. It begins at the **sinoatrial (SA) node** (pacemaker) in the right atrium, generating impulses. These impulses spread through the atria, causing atrial contraction. They then reach the **atrioventricular (AV) node**, which delays the impulse briefly. From the AV node, the impulse travels down the **Bundle of His** and into the **Purkinje fibers**, rapidly spreading through the ventricles, causing ventricular contraction.
27. **Describe the factors that affect blood pressure.**
    *   Blood pressure is influenced by several factors. **Cardiac output** (heart rate x stroke volume) directly affects it; higher output means higher pressure. **Peripheral resistance**, determined by the diameter of arterioles (vasoconstriction increases, vasodilation decreases), also plays a major role. Other factors include blood volume, blood viscosity, elasticity of arterial walls, and hormonal and nervous regulation.
28. **Explain the causes and symptoms of heart failure.**
    *   Heart failure occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's demands. Causes include coronary artery disease, hypertension, heart attack, valve problems, and arrhythmias. Symptoms often include shortness of breath (dyspnea), fatigue, swelling in the legs and ankles (edema), and reduced exercise tolerance, as the heart struggles to maintain adequate circulation.
29. **Describe the structure and function of blood vessels.**
    *   Blood vessels form a closed network for blood circulation. **Arteries** (thick, muscular, elastic walls) carry blood away from the heart under high pressure. **Veins** (thinner, less muscular walls, contain valves) carry blood towards the heart under low pressure. **Capillaries** (one-cell thick walls) are the smallest vessels, forming networks where exchange of gases, nutrients, and wastes occurs between blood and tissues.
30. **Explain the role of the liver in blood composition.**
    *   The liver plays a vital role in maintaining blood composition. It synthesizes most plasma proteins (e.g., albumin, fibrinogen, globulins). It also processes nutrients absorbed from the digestive tract (via the hepatic portal system), detoxifies harmful substances, and stores vitamins and minerals. The liver is also involved in the breakdown of old RBCs and the production of clotting factors.
31. **Describe erythropoiesis and its regulation.**
    *   Erythropoiesis is the process of red blood cell formation. In adults, it primarily occurs in the red bone marrow. It is regulated by the hormone erythropoietin, which is produced by the kidneys in response to hypoxia (low oxygen levels). Erythropoietin stimulates the bone marrow to increase RBC production, thereby increasing the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.
32. **Explain the functions of hemoglobin.**
    *   Hemoglobin is the primary protein in red blood cells, crucial for gas transport. Its main function is to reversibly bind to oxygen in the lungs (forming oxyhemoglobin) and release it in the tissues. It also plays a role in carbon dioxide transport, binding to a small percentage of CO₂ (forming carbaminohemoglobin) and acting as a buffer for hydrogen ions, contributing to pH regulation.
33. **Describe the life cycle of RBCs.**
    *   RBCs are formed in the red bone marrow (erythropoiesis) and circulate for about 120 days. Old and damaged RBCs are removed from circulation by macrophages, primarily in the spleen and liver. Hemoglobin is broken down: iron is recycled, and the heme portion is converted to bilirubin, which is excreted in bile. The globin chains are broken down into amino acids and reused.
34. **Explain the role of the spleen in blood functions.**
    *   The spleen is a vital organ involved in several blood functions. It acts as a filter for blood, removing old and damaged red blood cells and platelets. It also serves as a reservoir for blood and platelets. Furthermore, the spleen plays a significant role in the immune system, containing lymphocytes and macrophages that help fight infections and produce antibodies.
35. **Describe the structure and function of platelets.**
    *   Platelets (thrombocytes) are small, irregular, anucleated cell fragments derived from megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. Their primary function is to prevent blood loss by initiating blood clotting. They achieve this by adhering to injured vessel walls, aggregating to form a temporary plug, and releasing factors that activate the coagulation cascade, leading to the formation of a stable fibrin clot.
36. **Explain cross-matching in blood transfusion.**
    *   Cross-matching is a critical procedure performed before blood transfusions to ensure compatibility between donor and recipient blood. It involves mixing a sample of the recipient's serum with donor red blood cells to check for agglutination (clumping). If agglutination occurs, it indicates an incompatibility, and the blood unit cannot be transfused, preventing potentially fatal hemolytic transfusion reactions.
37. **Describe the clotting cascade in detail.**
    *   The clotting cascade is a complex series of enzymatic reactions leading to fibrin clot formation. It involves intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, both converging on a common pathway. The common pathway begins with the activation of Factor X, which, along with Factor V and calcium, converts prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then catalyzes the conversion of soluble fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin monomers, which polymerize to form a stable fibrin mesh, trapping blood cells and forming the clot.
38. **Explain the formation of atherosclerotic plaques.**
    *   Atherosclerotic plaques form due to chronic inflammation and injury to the inner lining of arteries (endothelium). This injury allows LDL cholesterol to accumulate in the arterial wall, where it becomes oxidized. Macrophages engulf the oxidized LDL, becoming foam cells, which contribute to a fatty streak. Over time, smooth muscle cells migrate, fibrous tissue and calcium deposit, forming a hard plaque that narrows the artery lumen.
39. **Describe the cardiac conduction system.**
    *   The cardiac conduction system is a specialized network of cardiac muscle cells that initiates and transmits electrical impulses throughout the heart, ensuring coordinated contraction. It comprises the SA node (pacemaker), AV node (delays impulse), Bundle of His, bundle branches, and Purkinje fibers. This system allows the heart to beat rhythmically and efficiently without external nervous input, though it is modulated by the nervous system.
40. **Explain the Frank-Starling law of the heart.**
    *   The Frank-Starling law of the heart states that, within physiological limits, the stroke volume of the heart increases in response to an increase in the volume of blood filling the heart (end-diastolic volume). This means that the heart pumps out all the blood that returns to it. Greater venous return leads to greater stretch of ventricular muscle fibers, resulting in a more forceful contraction and increased stroke volume.
41. **Describe the regulation of heart rate.**
    *   Heart rate is primarily regulated by the autonomic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system (via norepinephrine) increases heart rate and contractility. The parasympathetic nervous system (via acetylcholine from the vagus nerve) decreases heart rate. Hormones like epinephrine and thyroid hormones also increase heart rate. Other factors include body temperature, age, and fitness level.
42. **Explain the measurement of cardiac output.**
    *   Cardiac output (CO) is the volume of blood pumped by the heart per minute. It is calculated as Heart Rate (HR) multiplied by Stroke Volume (SV) (CO = HR x SV). While HR can be easily measured, SV is more complex. CO can be measured invasively (e.g., thermodilution, Fick principle) or non-invasively (e.g., echocardiography, impedance cardiography).
43. **Describe the structure of the heart wall.**
    *   The heart wall consists of three layers. The **epicardium** is the outermost layer, a visceral layer of the serous pericardium. The **myocardium** is the thickest middle layer, composed of cardiac muscle responsible for the heart's pumping action. The **endocardium** is the innermost layer, a thin, smooth membrane lining the heart chambers and covering the heart valves, providing a frictionless surface for blood flow.
44. **Explain the pericardium and its functions.**
    *   The pericardium is a double-walled membranous sac that encloses the heart. It consists of a tough fibrous outer layer and a serous inner layer (parietal and visceral). The space between the serous layers contains pericardial fluid. Its functions include protecting the heart from infection and overfilling, anchoring it within the mediastinum, and reducing friction during heartbeats due to the lubricating pericardial fluid.
45. **Describe the coronary blood supply.**
    *   The coronary circulation is the system of blood vessels that supplies oxygenated blood and nutrients to the heart muscle (myocardium) itself. The main coronary arteries (right and left) branch off the aorta just above the aortic valve. These arteries further divide into smaller vessels that penetrate the myocardium. Deoxygenated blood from the heart muscle is collected by cardiac veins and drains into the coronary sinus, which empties into the right atrium.
46. **Explain arrhythmias and their types.**
    *   Arrhythmias are irregular heartbeats, meaning the heart beats too fast (tachycardia), too slow (bradycardia), or with an irregular rhythm. They result from problems with the heart's electrical conduction system. Types include atrial fibrillation (irregular, rapid atrial beats), ventricular tachycardia (rapid, abnormal ventricular beats), and bradycardia (slow heart rate). Symptoms can range from palpitations to dizziness or fainting.
47. **Describe artificial cardiac devices.**
    *   Artificial cardiac devices are medical implants designed to support or replace heart function. **Artificial pacemakers** are small devices implanted to regulate heart rhythm in bradycardia or certain arrhythmias. **Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs)** monitor heart rhythm and deliver electrical shocks to correct life-threatening tachyarrhythmias. **Ventricular assist devices (VADs)** are mechanical pumps that help a weakened heart pump blood.
48. **Explain the causes of hypertension.**
    *   Hypertension (high blood pressure) can be primary (essential) or secondary. Primary hypertension has no identifiable cause but is influenced by genetics, lifestyle (diet, lack of exercise, smoking, alcohol), and stress. Secondary hypertension is caused by an underlying condition, such as kidney disease, thyroid problems, or certain medications.
49. **Describe the complications of atherosclerosis.**
    *   Atherosclerosis, the hardening and narrowing of arteries due to plaque buildup, can lead to severe complications. These include coronary artery disease (angina, heart attack), stroke (if plaques affect brain arteries), peripheral artery disease (reduced blood flow to limbs), kidney disease, and aneurysm formation. These complications arise from reduced blood flow, clot formation, or rupture of weakened vessels.
50. **Explain preventive measures for cardiovascular diseases.**
    *   Preventive measures for cardiovascular diseases focus on lifestyle modifications and managing risk factors. Key strategies include maintaining a healthy diet (low in saturated fats, sodium), regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, quitting smoking, limiting alcohol intake, managing stress, and controlling underlying conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol through medication if necessary.
51. **Describe the role of exercise in cardiovascular health.**
    *   Regular exercise significantly benefits cardiovascular health. It strengthens the heart muscle, improves blood circulation, lowers blood pressure, reduces LDL ("bad") cholesterol and increases HDL ("good") cholesterol, helps maintain a healthy weight, and improves insulin sensitivity. These effects collectively reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular conditions.
52. **Explain the effects of smoking on the circulatory system.**
    *   Smoking has detrimental effects on the circulatory system. It damages the lining of blood vessels, promoting atherosclerosis and increasing the risk of blood clots. Nicotine raises heart rate and blood pressure. Carbon monoxide reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood. These effects significantly increase the risk of coronary artery disease, heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease.
53. **Describe dietary factors affecting cardiovascular health.**
    *   Dietary factors significantly impact cardiovascular health. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats (e.g., monounsaturated, polyunsaturated) is beneficial. Limiting saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, sodium, and added sugars is crucial. Excessive intake of these unhealthy components contributes to high cholesterol, hypertension, obesity, and increased risk of heart disease.
54. **Explain stress and its impact on heart function.**
    *   Chronic stress can negatively impact heart function. It activates the sympathetic nervous system, leading to increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, and release of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. Over time, this can contribute to hypertension, inflammation, and damage to blood vessels, increasing the risk of heart disease and heart attack. Stress management techniques are important for cardiovascular health.
55. **Describe age-related changes in the circulatory system.**
    *   With aging, the circulatory system undergoes several changes. Arteries tend to stiffen and become less elastic (arteriosclerosis), leading to increased systolic blood pressure. The heart muscle may thicken, and its pumping efficiency can slightly decrease. The SA node may lose some cells, potentially leading to arrhythmias. These changes increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases in older adults.
56. **Explain gender differences in cardiovascular disease.**
    *   Cardiovascular disease (CVD) presents differently in men and women. Men typically develop CVD earlier in life. Women often experience different symptoms of heart attack (e.g., fatigue, nausea) than men (e.g., classic chest pain) and may be diagnosed later. Estrogen provides some protection to women before menopause, but after menopause, their risk increases and often surpasses that of men.
57. **Describe the role of genetics in heart disease.**
    *   Genetics plays a significant role in an individual's susceptibility to heart disease. A family history of early-onset heart disease (before age 55 in men, 65 in women) increases risk. Specific genetic mutations can cause conditions like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or familial hypercholesterolemia. However, genetics often interacts with lifestyle factors; a genetic predisposition does not guarantee disease if healthy lifestyle choices are made.
58. **Explain the Mediterranean diet and heart health.**
    *   The Mediterranean diet is a dietary pattern associated with significant cardiovascular benefits. It emphasizes plant-based foods (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts), healthy fats (olive oil as primary fat source), fish and poultry in moderation, and limited red meat and processed foods. This diet is rich in antioxidants, fiber, and monounsaturated fats, contributing to lower cholesterol, blood pressure, and reduced heart disease risk.
59. **Describe the effects of alcohol on circulation.**
    *   Moderate alcohol consumption may have some protective effects on the heart, but excessive alcohol intake is detrimental to circulation. Heavy drinking can raise blood pressure, contribute to arrhythmias (e.g., atrial fibrillation), weaken the heart muscle (alcoholic cardiomyopathy), and increase the risk of stroke. It can also lead to weight gain and increased triglyceride levels.
60. **Explain the relationship between diabetes and heart disease.**
    *   Diabetes significantly increases the risk of heart disease. High blood sugar levels over time damage blood vessels and nerves that control the heart. This leads to accelerated atherosclerosis, increasing the risk of coronary artery disease, heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Diabetes also often coexists with other risk factors like hypertension, high cholesterol, and obesity, further compounding the risk.
61. **Describe the role of cholesterol in cardiovascular health.**
    *   Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance essential for cell membranes and hormone production. However, high levels of certain types of cholesterol are detrimental to cardiovascular health. High LDL ("bad") cholesterol contributes to plaque formation in arteries (atherosclerosis). High HDL ("good") cholesterol helps remove excess cholesterol from arteries. Maintaining a healthy balance is crucial for preventing heart disease.
62. **Explain the difference between good and bad cholesterol.**
    *   **LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein) cholesterol** is considered "bad" cholesterol because it contributes to the buildup of fatty plaques in arteries, leading to atherosclerosis and increasing the risk of heart disease. **HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein) cholesterol** is considered "good" cholesterol because it helps remove excess cholesterol from the arteries and transport it back to the liver for excretion, thus protecting against heart disease.
63. **Describe the metabolic syndrome.**
    *   Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that occur together, increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. These conditions include increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels. Having at least three of these conditions indicates metabolic syndrome.
64. **Explain the role of inflammation in heart disease.**
    *   Inflammation plays a crucial role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis and heart disease. Chronic low-grade inflammation in the arterial walls, often triggered by factors like high cholesterol, hypertension, and smoking, contributes to the initiation and growth of atherosclerotic plaques. Inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein (CRP) are associated with increased cardiovascular risk.
65. **Describe cardiac rehabilitation programs.**
    *   Cardiac rehabilitation is a medically supervised program designed to improve the health and well-being of people who have heart problems. It typically includes exercise training, education on heart-healthy living (diet, stress management), and counseling to reduce risk factors and improve quality of life. It is often recommended after a heart attack, heart surgery, or for heart failure.
66. **Explain the use of aspirin in cardiovascular prevention.**
    *   Aspirin is an antiplatelet medication commonly used in cardiovascular prevention. It works by inhibiting platelet aggregation, thereby reducing the risk of blood clot formation in arteries. It is often prescribed for individuals with established cardiovascular disease (secondary prevention) or those at high risk (primary prevention) to prevent heart attacks and strokes.
67. **Describe beta-blockers and their cardiac effects.**
    *   Beta-blockers are a class of medications that block the effects of adrenaline (epinephrine) on beta-receptors in the heart. This slows the heart rate, reduces the force of heart contractions, and lowers blood pressure. They are used to treat hypertension, angina, arrhythmias, and heart failure, reducing the heart's workload and oxygen demand.
68. **Explain ACE inhibitors and their uses.**
    *   ACE (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme) inhibitors are medications that block the production of angiotensin II, a powerful vasoconstrictor. By doing so, they relax blood vessels, lower blood pressure, and reduce the heart's workload. They are widely used to treat hypertension, heart failure, and to protect the kidneys in people with diabetes.
69. **Describe diuretics and their role in hypertension.**
    *   Diuretics, often called "water pills," are medications that help the body eliminate excess sodium and water through urine. This reduces the fluid volume in blood vessels, thereby lowering blood pressure. They are commonly used to treat hypertension, heart failure (to reduce fluid retention), and edema.
70. **Explain calcium channel blockers.**
    *   Calcium channel blockers are medications that relax and widen blood vessels by blocking calcium from entering muscle cells in the heart and blood vessel walls. This lowers blood pressure and can slow heart rate. They are used to treat hypertension, angina, and some arrhythmias.
71. **Describe the surgical treatments for heart disease.**
    *   Surgical treatments for heart disease include:
        *   **Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery:** Bypassing blocked coronary arteries with grafts from other vessels.
        *   **Heart valve repair/replacement:** Correcting or replacing diseased heart valves.
        *   **Heart transplantation:** Replacing a severely diseased heart with a donor heart.
        *   **Aneurysm repair:** Repairing weakened, bulging sections of arteries.
72. **Explain angioplasty and stenting.**
    *   **Angioplasty** is a minimally invasive procedure to widen narrowed or blocked arteries. A balloon-tipped catheter is inserted and inflated at the blockage site to compress the plaque. **Stenting** often follows angioplasty; a small mesh tube (stent) is placed in the artery to keep it open and prevent re-narrowing. These procedures restore blood flow to the heart muscle.
73. **Describe bypass surgery.**
    *   Bypass surgery, specifically Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery, is a major surgical procedure to improve blood flow to the heart. A healthy blood vessel (graft) from another part of the body (e.g., leg vein, internal mammary artery) is used to create a new path around a blocked or narrowed coronary artery, bypassing the obstruction and restoring blood supply to the heart muscle.
74. **Explain heart transplantation.**
    *   Heart transplantation is a surgical procedure where a diseased, failing heart is replaced with a healthy donor heart. It is a last-resort treatment for patients with end-stage heart failure who have exhausted all other medical and surgical options. It significantly improves quality of life and survival, but requires lifelong immunosuppression to prevent organ rejection.
75. **Describe the artificial heart.**
    *   An artificial heart is a prosthetic device designed to replace the natural heart's pumping function. Total artificial hearts (TAHs) are used as a bridge to transplantation for patients with end-stage biventricular heart failure. Ventricular assist devices (VADs) are partial artificial hearts that support one or both ventricles. They provide mechanical circulatory support, improving blood flow and organ function.
76. **Explain cardiac catheterization.**
    *   Cardiac catheterization is an invasive diagnostic procedure where a thin, flexible tube (catheter) is inserted into a blood vessel (usually in the groin or wrist) and guided to the heart. It allows doctors to measure pressures, take blood samples, and perform angiography (injecting dye to visualize coronary arteries) to diagnose coronary artery disease, valve problems, and other heart conditions.
77. **Describe echocardiography.**
    *   Echocardiography is a non-invasive imaging test that uses sound waves (ultrasound) to create moving pictures of the heart. It provides detailed information about the heart's structure (chambers, valves), function (pumping ability, blood flow), and any abnormalities. It is widely used to diagnose and monitor various heart conditions, including heart failure, valve disease, and congenital heart defects.
78. **Explain stress testing.**
    *   Stress testing (e.g., exercise stress test, pharmacological stress test) evaluates how the heart performs under physical or pharmacological stress. It helps diagnose coronary artery disease by detecting abnormalities in heart function (e.g., ECG changes, symptoms) that occur when the heart's oxygen demand exceeds its supply. It can also assess exercise capacity and guide treatment.
79. **Describe nuclear cardiac imaging.**
    *   Nuclear cardiac imaging (e.g., myocardial perfusion imaging) uses small amounts of radioactive tracers injected into the bloodstream to create images of blood flow to the heart muscle. It helps identify areas of reduced blood flow (ischemia) or damaged heart muscle (infarction), aiding in the diagnosis and assessment of coronary artery disease and heart attack.
80. **Explain the role of CT and MRI in cardiology.**
    *   **Cardiac CT (Computed Tomography)** provides detailed anatomical images of the heart and coronary arteries, useful for detecting coronary artery calcification and blockages. **Cardiac MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)** offers excellent soft tissue contrast, providing detailed information on heart structure, function, blood flow, and tissue characterization (e.g., scar tissue, inflammation), without radiation exposure. Both are valuable non-invasive diagnostic tools.
81. **Describe blood tests used in cardiac diagnosis.**
    *   Several blood tests are used in cardiac diagnosis. **Cardiac enzymes/biomarkers** (e.g., troponin) are released into the blood when heart muscle is damaged (e.g., heart attack). **Lipid panel** measures cholesterol and triglycerides. **C-reactive protein (CRP)** indicates inflammation. **Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)** is elevated in heart failure. These tests help diagnose, assess risk, and monitor heart conditions.
82. **Explain troponins and their significance.**
    *   Troponins (cardiac troponin I and T) are proteins found specifically in heart muscle cells. When heart muscle is damaged (e.g., during a heart attack), troponins are released into the bloodstream. Elevated troponin levels are highly sensitive and specific biomarkers for myocardial injury, making them crucial for diagnosing heart attacks and assessing their severity.
83. **Describe CRP and its cardiac relevance.**
    *   C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker of inflammation in the body. High-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) levels are used in cardiac risk assessment. Elevated hs-CRP indicates chronic low-grade inflammation, which is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events, even in individuals with normal cholesterol levels. It serves as an independent predictor of heart disease.
84. **Explain BNP and its uses.**
    *   Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a hormone primarily released by the ventricles of the heart in response to increased pressure and volume overload. Elevated BNP levels are a strong indicator of heart failure. It is used to diagnose heart failure, assess its severity, monitor treatment effectiveness, and differentiate heart failure from other causes of shortness of breath.
85. **Describe lipid profile testing.**
    *   A lipid profile is a blood test that measures the levels of different fats (lipids) in the blood. It typically includes total cholesterol, LDL ("bad") cholesterol, HDL ("good") cholesterol, and triglycerides. This test is crucial for assessing an individual's risk of developing atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease, guiding lifestyle modifications and medication decisions.
86. **Explain HbA1c and cardiovascular risk.**
    *   HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) is a blood test that reflects average blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months. It is primarily used to diagnose and monitor diabetes. High HbA1c levels indicate poorly controlled diabetes, which significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by damaging blood vessels and promoting atherosclerosis. Maintaining a healthy HbA1c is vital for reducing cardiovascular risk in diabetics.
87. **Describe emergency cardiac care.**
    *   Emergency cardiac care refers to the immediate medical interventions provided to individuals experiencing acute cardiac events like cardiac arrest or heart attack. It follows a "chain of survival" including early recognition, early CPR, early defibrillation, early advanced life support, and post-cardiac arrest care. The goal is to restore circulation, preserve heart and brain function, and improve survival outcomes.
88. **Explain CPR and its importance.**
    *   CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) is a life-saving emergency procedure performed when someone's breathing or heart has stopped. It involves chest compressions and rescue breaths to maintain blood flow to the brain and other vital organs until professional medical help arrives. CPR is crucial because it can double or triple a person's chance of survival from cardiac arrest.
89. **Describe automated external defibrillators.**
    *   Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) are portable electronic devices that can automatically diagnose life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias (like ventricular fibrillation) and deliver an electrical shock (defibrillation) to restore a normal heart rhythm. AEDs are designed for use by laypersons and are increasingly available in public places, significantly improving survival rates from sudden cardiac arrest.
90. **Explain the chain of survival in cardiac arrest.**
    *   The chain of survival is a sequence of actions that, when performed quickly and effectively, can improve the outcome for victims of cardiac arrest. It typically includes: 1) Early recognition of cardiac arrest and activation of emergency response. 2) Early CPR. 3) Early defibrillation. 4) Early advanced life support. 5) Integrated post-cardiac arrest care. Each link is crucial for survival.
91. **Describe the signs and symptoms of heart attack.**
    *   The classic sign of a heart attack is chest pain or discomfort, often described as pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain in the center of the chest that lasts more than a few minutes. Other symptoms can include pain radiating to the arm (especially left), back, neck, jaw, or stomach; shortness of breath; cold sweat; nausea; or lightheadedness. Women may experience more subtle symptoms like fatigue or indigestion.
92. **Explain the importance of rapid treatment in stroke.**
    *   Rapid treatment in stroke is critical because "time is brain." A stroke occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain is interrupted, causing brain cells to die. The faster blood flow is restored (e.g., with clot-busting drugs or mechanical thrombectomy), the more brain tissue can be saved, minimizing long-term disability. Recognizing stroke symptoms (FAST: Face drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulty, Time to call 911) is vital for prompt action.
93. **Describe first aid for cardiovascular emergencies.**
    *   First aid for cardiovascular emergencies involves immediate actions. For suspected heart attack, call emergency services, have the person chew aspirin (if not allergic), and keep them calm. For cardiac arrest, immediately begin CPR and use an AED if available. For stroke, recognize FAST symptoms and call emergency services immediately. The priority is to get professional medical help as quickly as possible.
94. **Explain when to call emergency services.**
    *   Call emergency services (e.g., 911) immediately for any suspected cardiovascular emergency. This includes:
        *   Chest pain or discomfort that lasts more than a few minutes, or goes away and comes back.
        *   Symptoms of stroke (FAST).
        *   Sudden severe shortness of breath.
        *   Sudden weakness or numbness on one side of the body.
        *   Sudden severe headache.
        *   Any situation where a person collapses or is unresponsive.
95. **Describe lifestyle modifications for heart health.**
    *   Lifestyle modifications are fundamental for heart health. These include adopting a heart-healthy diet (rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein), engaging in regular physical activity (at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week), maintaining a healthy weight, quitting smoking, limiting alcohol consumption, and managing stress effectively. These changes can significantly reduce cardiovascular risk.
96. **Explain the DASH diet.**
    *   The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet is an eating plan designed to lower blood pressure. It emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy products. It limits saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium. The DASH diet is rich in potassium, magnesium, and calcium, which are important for blood pressure control, and has been shown to be very effective in reducing hypertension.
97. **Describe the benefits of regular exercise.**
    *   Regular exercise offers numerous cardiovascular benefits. It strengthens the heart muscle, improves blood circulation, lowers blood pressure, helps manage cholesterol levels, aids in weight control, and reduces stress. These effects collectively decrease the risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and improve overall physical and mental well-being.
98. **Explain stress management techniques.**
    *   Stress management techniques are crucial for cardiovascular health. They include:
        *   **Relaxation techniques:** Deep breathing, meditation, yoga.
        *   **Physical activity:** Regular exercise helps release tension.
        *   **Time management:** Prioritizing tasks, avoiding overcommitment.
        *   **Social support:** Connecting with friends and family.
        *   **Hobbies and interests:** Engaging in enjoyable activities.
        *   **Professional help:** Counseling or therapy for chronic stress.
99. **Describe smoking cessation strategies.**
    *   Smoking cessation is one of the most impactful actions for improving cardiovascular health. Strategies include:
        *   **Setting a quit date.**
        *   **Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT):** Patches, gum, lozenges.
        *   **Medications:** Bupropion, varenicline.
        *   **Behavioral counseling and support groups.**
        *   **Avoiding triggers.**
        *   **Seeking professional help.**
100. **Explain the importance of regular health check-ups.**
    *   Regular health check-ups are vital for early detection and management of cardiovascular risk factors and diseases. They allow healthcare providers to monitor blood pressure, cholesterol levels, blood sugar, and weight. Early identification of issues like hypertension or high cholesterol enables timely interventions through lifestyle changes or medication, preventing the progression to more serious cardiovascular events.

    ## Section D: Long Answer Questions (3 marks each) - Answers

1.  **Describe the detailed composition of blood and explain the functions of each component.**
    *   Blood is a specialized connective tissue composed of a fluid matrix called **plasma** (approximately 55% of blood volume) and **formed elements** (approximately 45% of blood volume).
        *   **Plasma:**
            *   **Composition:** Straw-colored, viscous fluid, primarily water (90-92%). Contains 6-8% proteins (fibrinogen, globulins, albumins), minerals (Na⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, HCO₃⁻, Cl⁻), glucose, amino acids, lipids, hormones, and metabolic wastes.
            *   **Functions:**
                *   **Transport:** Carries nutrients, hormones, waste products, and gases throughout the body.
                *   **Osmotic Balance:** Albumins maintain osmotic pressure, preventing fluid loss from blood vessels.
                *   **Clotting:** Fibrinogen is essential for blood coagulation.
                *   **Immunity:** Globulins (antibodies) provide defense against pathogens.
                *   **pH Regulation:** Plasma proteins and bicarbonate ions act as buffers.
        *   **Formed Elements:**
            *   **Erythrocytes (Red Blood Cells - RBCs):**
                *   **Composition/Structure:** Most abundant cells, biconcave, anucleated (in mammals), contain hemoglobin (iron-containing protein).
                *   **Functions:** Primary function is oxygen transport from lungs to tissues and a small amount of carbon dioxide transport from tissues to lungs.
            *   **Leucocytes (White Blood Cells - WBCs):**
                *   **Composition/Structure:** Nucleated, less numerous than RBCs. Classified into granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils) and agranulocytes (lymphocytes, monocytes).
                *   **Functions:** Crucial for the immune system, defending the body against infections, foreign substances, and abnormal cells.
            *   **Platelets (Thrombocytes):**
                *   **Composition/Structure:** Cell fragments produced from megakaryocytes.
                *   **Functions:** Essential for blood coagulation (clotting) to prevent excessive blood loss from injured vessels.
    *   The integrated functions of these components ensure blood's vital roles in transport, defense, and homeostasis.
2.  **Explain the structure, formation, and functions of red blood cells in detail.**
    *   **Structure:** Erythrocytes (RBCs) are highly specialized cells adapted for oxygen transport. In mammals, they are biconcave discs, which increases their surface area-to-volume ratio, facilitating rapid gas diffusion. They are anucleated (lack a nucleus) and lack most organelles, allowing more space for hemoglobin. Their flexible membrane enables them to squeeze through narrow capillaries. Each RBC contains millions of hemoglobin molecules.
    *   **Formation (Erythropoiesis):** In adults, RBCs are formed in the red bone marrow, primarily in the axial skeleton and proximal ends of long bones. The process begins with hematopoietic stem cells, which differentiate and mature through several stages: proerythroblast, erythroblasts, and reticulocytes (immature RBCs). Reticulocytes are released into the bloodstream and mature into erythrocytes within 1-2 days. Erythropoiesis is regulated by the hormone erythropoietin (EPO), produced by the kidneys in response to hypoxia (low oxygen levels).
    *   **Functions:**
        *   **Oxygen Transport:** The primary function. Hemoglobin reversibly binds to oxygen in the lungs (forming oxyhemoglobin) where oxygen partial pressure is high, and releases it in the tissues where oxygen partial pressure is low.
        *   **Carbon Dioxide Transport:** Hemoglobin also transports a small percentage of carbon dioxide (as carbaminohemoglobin) from tissues to the lungs.
        *   **pH Regulation:** Hemoglobin acts as a buffer, binding to hydrogen ions and helping to maintain blood pH.
    *   RBCs have a lifespan of about 120 days, after which they are removed from circulation by macrophages in the spleen and liver.
3.  **Describe the classification of white blood cells and explain the specific functions of each type.**
    *   White Blood Cells (WBCs) or leucocytes are nucleated blood cells crucial for the body's immune defense. They are classified into two main categories based on the presence or absence of cytoplasmic granules:
        *   **Granulocytes:** Characterized by prominent cytoplasmic granules and lobed nuclei.
            *   **Neutrophils:** Most abundant WBCs (60-65%). They are highly phagocytic, acting as the first responders to bacterial infections and inflammation. They engulf and destroy bacteria and cellular debris.
            *   **Eosinophils:** (2-3% of WBCs). Associated with allergic reactions and defense against parasitic infections. They release enzymes that combat the effects of histamine and destroy parasites.
            *   **Basophils:** (0.5-1% of WBCs). Secrete histamine (a vasodilator and inflammatory mediator), serotonin (a vasoconstrictor), and heparin (an anticoagulant). They are involved in inflammatory and allergic responses.
        *   **Agranulocytes:** Lack prominent cytoplasmic granules and have a single, unlobed nucleus.
            *   **Lymphocytes:** (20-25% of WBCs). Key players in specific (adaptive) immunity.
                *   **B Lymphocytes (B cells):** Upon activation, they differentiate into plasma cells that produce and secrete antibodies. Antibodies specifically target and neutralize pathogens.
                *   **T Lymphocytes (T cells):** Directly attack infected cells (e.g., virus-infected, cancer cells) or regulate other immune responses.
            *   **Monocytes:** (6-8% of WBCs). Phagocytic cells that circulate in the blood and then migrate into tissues, where they differentiate into macrophages. Macrophages are powerful phagocytes that engulf large pathogens, dead cells, and cellular debris, and also act as antigen-presenting cells to initiate specific immune responses.
    *   The diverse functions of WBCs provide a comprehensive and coordinated defense system against a wide range of threats to the body.
4.  **Explain the process of blood coagulation in detail, including all the factors involved.**
    *   Blood coagulation (clotting) is a complex, multi-step process that prevents excessive blood loss from injured vessels. It involves three main phases:
        1.  **Vascular Spasm:** Immediate vasoconstriction of the injured blood vessel, reducing blood flow.
        2.  **Platelet Plug Formation:** Platelets adhere to exposed collagen, activate, and aggregate to form a temporary plug.
        3.  **Coagulation (Blood Clotting):** A cascade of enzymatic reactions involving numerous plasma proteins called clotting factors (I-XIII), calcium ions (Ca²⁺), and phospholipids.
            *   **Initiation:** Extrinsic (triggered by tissue factor from damaged tissue) and intrinsic (triggered by contact with exposed collagen) pathways converge.
            *   **Common Pathway:** Both pathways lead to the activation of Factor X. Activated Factor X (Xa), along with Factor V, platelet phospholipids, and Ca²⁺, forms the **prothrombin activator complex**.
            *   **Thrombin Formation:** Prothrombin activator converts inactive **prothrombin** (Factor II) into active **thrombin** (Factor IIa).
            *   **Fibrin Formation:** Thrombin converts soluble plasma protein **fibrinogen** (Factor I) into insoluble **fibrin monomers**, which polymerize to form long, insoluble **fibrin threads**.
            *   **Clot Stabilization:** Thrombin also activates Factor XIII (fibrin stabilizing factor), which cross-links the fibrin threads, forming a strong, stable meshwork that traps formed elements, creating the definitive blood clot.
    *   This intricate cascade ensures rapid and localized clot formation at the site of injury.
5.  **Describe the ABO and Rh blood group systems and explain their clinical significance.**
    *   **ABO Blood Group System:**
        *   **Basis:** Presence or absence of two specific carbohydrate antigens (A and B) on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs).
        *   **Antibodies:** Individuals naturally produce antibodies in their plasma against the A or B antigens that are *not* present on their own RBCs.
        *   **Groups:** Group A (A antigen, anti-B antibodies), Group B (B antigen, anti-A antibodies), Group AB (A and B antigens, no antibodies - universal recipient), Group O (no antigens, anti-A and anti-B antibodies - universal donor).
    *   **Rh Blood Group System:**
        *   **Basis:** Presence or absence of the Rh antigen (D antigen) on the surface of RBCs.
        *   **Antigens/Antibodies:** Rh-positive (Rh⁺) individuals have the D antigen; Rh-negative (Rh⁻) individuals do not. Anti-Rh antibodies are *not* naturally present but can be formed by an Rh⁻ individual if exposed to Rh⁺ blood.
    *   **Clinical Significance:**
        *   **Blood Transfusions:** Crucial for safe transfusions. Transfusing incompatible blood leads to a severe hemolytic transfusion reaction, where recipient antibodies attack and destroy donor RBCs, causing agglutination, hemolysis, kidney failure, shock, and can be fatal. Cross-matching is performed before transfusion.
        *   **Erythroblastosis Foetalis (Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn - HDN):** Arises from Rh incompatibility. If an Rh⁻ mother carries an Rh⁺ fetus, maternal anti-Rh antibodies can cross the placenta in subsequent pregnancies and destroy fetal RBCs, leading to severe anemia and jaundice in the newborn. This can be prevented by administering Rh immune globulin (RhoGAM) to the Rh⁻ mother.
6.  **Explain the formation, composition, and functions of lymph in the human body.**
    *   **Formation:** Lymph (tissue fluid) is formed from blood plasma. As blood flows through capillaries, hydrostatic pressure forces water and small soluble substances out into the intercellular spaces. Most fluid returns to capillaries, but a small portion enters lymphatic capillaries, becoming lymph.
    *   **Composition:** Colorless, clear fluid, similar to plasma but with significantly lower protein content. Rich in specialized lymphocytes, some WBCs, absorbed fats, metabolic wastes, and cellular debris.
    *   **Functions:**
        1.  **Fluid Balance:** Collects excess tissue fluid and returns it to the bloodstream, preventing edema and maintaining blood volume.
        2.  **Immunity:** Transports lymphocytes and antigens to lymph nodes, where immune responses are initiated against trapped pathogens and foreign particles.
        3.  **Fat Absorption:** Specialized lymphatic capillaries (lacteals) in the small intestine absorb dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins, transporting them to the bloodstream.
7.  **Describe the anatomy of the human heart including chambers, valves, and blood vessels.**

        1.  **Joint Diastole (0.4 sec):** All four chambers relaxed. Blood flows passively from atria to ventricles. AV valves open, semilunar valves closed.
        2.  **Atrial Systole (0.1 sec):** SA node fires (P-wave on ECG), atria contract, pushing remaining blood into ventricles.
        3.  **Ventricular Systole (0.3 sec):** Ventricles contract (QRS complex on ECG).
            *   **Isovolumetric Contraction:** AV valves close ("lub" sound). All valves closed.
            *   **Ejection Phase:** Ventricular pressure opens semilunar valves, blood ejected into pulmonary artery and aorta.
        4.  **Ventricular Diastole (0.4 sec, overlapping):** Ventricles relax (T-wave on ECG).
            *   **Isovolumetric Relaxation:** Semilunar valves close ("dub" sound). All valves closed.
            *   **Ventricular Filling:** AV valves open, ventricles rapidly fill.
9.  **Describe the electrical conduction system of the heart and explain how it controls heartbeat.**
    *   The heart's electrical conduction system generates and transmits impulses for coordinated heartbeat.

        2.  **Atrioventricular (AV) Node:** Receives impulse from atria, delays it briefly, allowing full ventricular filling.
        3.  **Bundle of His (AV Bundle):** Transmits impulse from AV node to ventricles.
        4.  **Right and Left Bundle Branches:** Carry impulse down interventricular septum.
        5.  **Purkinje Fibers:** Rapidly distribute impulse throughout ventricular myocardium, causing synchronized ventricular depolarization (QRS complex on ECG) and contraction.
    *   This system ensures efficient, rhythmic pumping.
10. **Explain double circulation in humans and describe its advantages over single circulation.**
    *   **Double Circulation:** Blood flows through the heart twice to complete one full circuit.
        *   **Pulmonary Circulation:** Deoxygenated blood from right ventricle to lungs for oxygenation, then oxygenated blood returns to left atrium.
        *   **Systemic Circulation:** Oxygenated blood from left ventricle to body tissues, then deoxygenated blood returns to right atrium.
    *   **Advantages over Single Circulation:**
        1.  **Complete Separation:** Oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept separate, maximizing oxygen delivery to tissues.
        2.  **Higher Systemic Blood Pressure:** Left ventricle generates high pressure for efficient and rapid blood delivery to distant body parts.
        3.  **Increased Efficiency:** Optimizes gas exchange in lungs and nutrient/oxygen delivery to body, supporting high metabolic rates.
11. **Describe blood pressure, its regulation, and the factors that affect it.**
    *   **Blood Pressure (BP):** Force exerted by blood on arterial walls (Systolic/Diastolic, e.g., 120/80 mmHg).
    *   **Regulation:**
        *   **Neural (Short-term):** Baroreceptors detect BP changes, signal medulla oblongata, which adjusts sympathetic/parasympathetic activity (heart rate, contractility, vasoconstriction).
        *   **Hormonal (Long-term):** RAAS (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system), ADH, adrenaline/noradrenaline increase BP. ANP decreases BP.

13. **Describe atherosclerosis, its development, consequences, and prevention strategies.**
    *   **Atherosclerosis:** Chronic inflammatory disease with fatty plaque buildup in arteries, leading to hardening/narrowing.
    *   **Development:** Endothelial injury → LDL accumulation → inflammation (foam cells) → plaque formation (fibrous tissue, calcium) → lumen narrowing → plaque rupture → thrombosis.
    *   **Consequences:** CAD (angina, MI), stroke, PAD, kidney disease, aneurysms.
    *   **Prevention:** Healthy diet (low saturated/trans fats, sodium), regular exercise, healthy weight, smoking cessation, stress management, control of hypertension/diabetes/cholesterol.
14. **Explain the differences between angina pectoris, heart attack, and cardiac arrest.**
    *   **Angina Pectoris:** Chest pain from temporary heart muscle ischemia (insufficient oxygen). Symptom of CAD, relieved by rest/nitroglycerin; no permanent damage.
    *   **Heart Attack (MI):** Permanent heart muscle damage/death due to prolonged blood supply blockage (usually clot in coronary artery). Severe, persistent pain, not relieved by rest.
    *   **Cardiac Arrest:** Sudden cessation of effective heart pumping (electrical malfunction). Person collapses, unresponsive, not breathing. Requires immediate CPR/defibrillation. A heart attack can lead to cardiac arrest.
15. **Describe the role of the lymphatic system in immunity and fluid balance.**
    *   **Fluid Balance:** Collects excess interstitial fluid (lymph) that leaks from capillaries and returns it to the bloodstream, preventing edema and maintaining blood volume.

    *   **HR Regulation:** Autonomic nervous system (sympathetic increases, parasympathetic decreases), hormones.
    *   **SV Regulation:**
        *   **Preload (Venous Return):** Frank-Starling law (greater stretch = stronger contraction).
        *   **Contractility:** Intrinsic strength (increased by sympathetic).
        *   **Afterload:** Resistance to ejection (increased afterload decreases SV).
    *   **Meeting Demands:** During exercise, increased sympathetic activity, venous return, and contractility rapidly increase HR and SV, thus CO, to deliver more oxygen.
