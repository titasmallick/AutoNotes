## Section C: Short Answer Questions (2 marks each)

1.  **Explain the structure and function of alveoli.**
    Alveoli are thin, irregular-walled, vascularized bag-like structures at the end of bronchioles. Their primary function is to provide a large surface area for efficient gas exchange (oxygen and carbon dioxide) between the air and blood.
2.  **Describe the mechanism of inspiration.**
    During inspiration, the diaphragm contracts and flattens, and external intercostal muscles contract, pulling ribs and sternum up and out. This increases thoracic volume, decreasing intrapulmonary pressure below atmospheric pressure, causing air to rush into the lungs.
3.  **Compare tidal volume and vital capacity.**
    Tidal volume (TV) is the volume of air inspired or expired during a normal, quiet breath (approx. 500 mL). Vital capacity (VC) is the maximum volume of air that can be exhaled after a maximal inspiration (TV + IRV + ERV), representing the total usable lung volume.
4.  **Explain the Bohr effect with its significance.**
    The Bohr effect describes the decrease in hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen when there's an increase in CO₂ concentration and H⁺ (lower pH). This is physiologically significant as it facilitates the release of oxygen from hemoglobin to the tissues where CO₂ and H⁺ levels are higher due to metabolic activity.
5.  **Describe the transport of oxygen in blood.**
    Oxygen is transported in the blood primarily by hemoglobin (97%) as oxyhemoglobin within red blood cells. A small percentage (3%) is transported in a dissolved state in the plasma.
6.  **Explain the chloride shift mechanism.**
    The chloride shift (Hamburger effect) is a process where bicarbonate ions (HCO₃⁻) move out of red blood cells into the plasma, and chloride ions (Cl⁻) move into the red blood cells to maintain electrical neutrality. This occurs as CO₂ is converted to HCO₃⁻ inside RBCs in tissues, and reverses in the lungs.
7.  **Compare asthma and emphysema.**
    Asthma is characterized by inflammation and narrowing of bronchi and bronchioles, leading to wheezing and difficulty breathing. Emphysema is a chronic disorder involving damage to alveolar walls, reducing the respiratory surface, primarily caused by cigarette smoking.
8.  **Describe the factors affecting oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve.**
    Factors affecting the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve include partial pressure of CO₂ (PCO₂), H⁺ concentration (pH), temperature, and 2,3-BPG levels. Increased PCO₂, H⁺, temperature, and 2,3-BPG cause a right shift (decreased O₂ affinity), while the opposite causes a left shift (increased O₂ affinity).
9.  **Explain the structure of the respiratory system.**
    The human respiratory system includes external nostrils, nasal chamber, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. The lungs, enclosed by a double-layered pleura, house the bronchial tree and alveoli, forming the primary organs for gas exchange.
10. **Describe the mechanism of expiration.**
    During expiration, the diaphragm relaxes and becomes dome-shaped, and external intercostal muscles relax, allowing the ribs and sternum to return to their original position. This decreases thoracic volume, increasing intrapulmonary pressure above atmospheric pressure, expelling air from the lungs.
11. **Compare conducting and respiratory zones.**
    The conducting zone extends from the nostrils to the terminal bronchioles; its function is to transport, humidify, and filter air. The respiratory zone consists of alveoli and their ducts, where actual gas exchange occurs.
12. **Explain the Haldane effect.**
    The Haldane effect describes the increased capacity of deoxygenated hemoglobin to bind CO₂ and H⁺. This is physiologically significant as it facilitates the uptake of CO₂ from tissues into the blood and its release in the lungs where hemoglobin becomes oxygenated.
13. **Describe carbon dioxide transport in blood.**
    Carbon dioxide is transported in the blood in three main forms: dissolved in plasma (7%), as bicarbonate ions (70%) formed in red blood cells and transported in plasma, and as carbaminohemoglobin (23%) bound to hemoglobin in red blood cells.
14. **Compare inspiratory and expiratory reserve volumes.**
    Inspiratory Reserve Volume (IRV) is the additional volume of air that can be forcefully inhaled after a normal inspiration (2500-3000 mL). Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV) is the additional volume of air that can be forcefully exhaled after a normal expiration (1000-1100 mL).
15. **Explain the role of carbonic anhydrase.**
    Carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme highly abundant in red blood cells. It rapidly catalyzes the reversible reaction of carbon dioxide and water to form carbonic acid (H₂CO₃), which then dissociates into H⁺ and HCO₃⁻, crucial for CO₂ transport.
16. **Describe the significance of 2,3-BPG.**
    2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) is a molecule produced in red blood cells that binds to hemoglobin and reduces its affinity for oxygen. Increased levels of 2,3-BPG (e.g., at high altitude or during exercise) cause a right shift in the ODC, facilitating oxygen release to tissues.
17. **Compare normal and abnormal breathing patterns.**
    Normal breathing (eupnea) is regular, effortless, and quiet. Abnormal patterns include tachypnea (rapid breathing), bradypnea (slow breathing), apnea (cessation of breathing), and Cheyne-Stokes breathing (alternating deep and shallow breaths with periods of apnea), often indicative of underlying conditions.
18. **Explain the structure and function of pleura.**
    The pleura is a double-layered membrane enclosing the lungs. The outer parietal pleura lines the thoracic cavity, and the inner visceral pleura covers the lung surface. The pleural fluid between them reduces friction during breathing and helps maintain lung expansion.
19. **Describe the factors affecting gas exchange.**
    Factors affecting gas exchange across the alveolar-capillary membrane include the partial pressure gradient of gases (driving force), solubility of gases (CO₂ is more soluble than O₂), and the thickness of the diffusion membrane. A larger surface area also enhances exchange.
20. **Compare left and right shifts of ODC.**
    A right shift of the Oxygen-Hemoglobin Dissociation Curve (ODC) indicates decreased hemoglobin affinity for O₂, facilitating O₂ release to tissues (caused by increased PCO₂, H⁺, temperature, 2,3-BPG). A left shift indicates increased affinity, facilitating O₂ binding in the lungs (opposite factors).
21. **Explain the mechanism of sound production.**
    Sound production (phonation) occurs in the larynx (voice box). Air passing through the vocal cords causes them to vibrate, producing sound. The tension and length of the vocal cords, controlled by laryngeal muscles, determine the pitch and quality of the voice.
22. **Describe the control of breathing.**
    Breathing is primarily controlled by the respiratory rhythm center in the medulla oblongata, which generates the basic rhythm. This center is influenced by chemoreceptors (detecting O₂, CO₂, H⁺ levels), pneumotaxic and apneustic centers in the pons, and higher brain centers, allowing for voluntary control and adaptation.
23. **Compare arterial and venous blood gas levels.**
    Arterial blood (oxygenated) has high PO₂ (approx. 95 mmHg) and low PCO₂ (approx. 40 mmHg). Venous blood (deoxygenated) has low PO₂ (approx. 40 mmHg) and high PCO₂ (approx. 45 mmHg), reflecting gas exchange in tissues.
24. **Explain the concept of dead space.**
    Dead space refers to the volume of air within the respiratory system that does not participate in gas exchange. Anatomical dead space is the volume of the conducting airways. Physiological dead space includes anatomical dead space plus any non-functional alveoli.
25. **Describe the effects of altitude on respiration.**
    At high altitudes, the lower atmospheric partial pressure of oxygen is lower, leading to hypoxemia. The body adapts by increasing respiratory rate and depth, increasing 2,3-BPG production (right shift of ODC), and over time, increasing red blood cell production (polycythemia).
26. **Compare fetal and adult hemoglobin.**
    Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin (HbA). This difference is crucial for oxygen transfer from the mother's blood to the fetus across the placenta, as HbF can effectively extract oxygen at lower PO₂ levels.
27. **Explain carbon monoxide poisoning.**
    Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning occurs when CO binds to hemoglobin with an affinity 200-250 times greater than oxygen, forming carboxyhemoglobin. This reduces oxygen-carrying capacity and shifts the ODC to the left, impairing oxygen release to tissues, leading to hypoxia and potentially death.
28. **Describe occupational respiratory disorders.**
    Occupational respiratory disorders are lung diseases caused by prolonged exposure to harmful substances in the workplace, such as silica dust (silicosis) or asbestos fibers (asbestosis). These exposures lead to inflammation, fibrosis, and reduced lung function.
29. **Compare restrictive and obstructive lung diseases.**
    Restrictive lung diseases (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis) reduce lung volumes and capacities due to decreased lung compliance or chest wall expansion. Obstructive lung diseases (e.g., asthma, emphysema) are characterized by increased airway resistance, making it difficult to exhale air.
30. **Explain the measurement of lung volumes.**
    Lung volumes (Tidal Volume, IRV, ERV) and capacities (IC, EC, VC, TLC, FRC) are measured using spirometry. However, Residual Volume (RV) and capacities that include RV (FRC, TLC) cannot be measured directly by spirometry and require other techniques like helium dilution or body plethysmography.
31. **Describe the structure of hemoglobin.**
    Hemoglobin is a globular protein found in red blood cells, composed of four polypeptide chains (two alpha and two beta in adult HbA), each associated with a heme group. Each heme group contains a central ferrous iron (Fe²⁺) atom, which reversibly binds one oxygen molecule.
32. **Compare oxygen and carbon dioxide solubility.**
    Carbon dioxide is significantly more soluble in water (and thus in blood plasma) than oxygen, by a factor of about 20-25 times. This higher solubility is crucial for CO₂ transport, especially in its dissolved form and for its rapid diffusion across membranes.
33. **Explain respiratory acidosis and alkalosis.**
    Respiratory acidosis results from hypoventilation, leading to CO₂ retention, increased PCO₂, and decreased blood pH. Respiratory alkalosis results from hyperventilation, leading to excessive CO₂ expulsion, decreased PCO₂, and increased blood pH. Both are compensated by renal mechanisms.
34. **Describe the role of surfactant.**
    Surfactant is a lipoprotein complex produced by type II alveolar cells. Its primary role is to reduce the surface tension of the fluid lining the alveoli, preventing their collapse during expiration and reducing the work of breathing.
35. **Compare central and peripheral chemoreceptors.**
    Central chemoreceptors are located in the medulla oblongata and are primarily sensitive to changes in H⁺ concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid, which reflects blood PCO₂. Peripheral chemoreceptors are located in the carotid and aortic bodies and are mainly sensitive to changes in arterial PO₂, but also respond to PCO₂ and H⁺.
36. **Explain the diving response.**
    The diving response (or diving reflex) is a set of physiological adaptations triggered by facial immersion in cold water, particularly in mammals. It includes bradycardia (slowing of heart rate), peripheral vasoconstriction (shunting blood to vital organs), and splenic contraction (releasing more red blood cells), conserving oxygen during breath-holding.
37. **Describe sleep-disordered breathing.**
    Sleep-disordered breathing encompasses conditions like sleep apnea, characterized by recurrent episodes of breathing cessation (apnea) or significantly reduced airflow (hypopnea) during sleep. This leads to fragmented sleep, daytime sleepiness, and increased risk of cardiovascular problems.
38. **Compare pneumonia and tuberculosis.**
    Pneumonia is an acute infection of the lung parenchyma, typically caused by bacteria or viruses, leading to inflammation and fluid accumulation in alveoli. Tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, primarily affecting the lungs but can spread to other organs, characterized by granuloma formation.
39. **Explain pulmonary circulation.**
    Pulmonary circulation is the part of the circulatory system that carries deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle of the heart to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen and releases carbon dioxide, and then returns oxygenated blood to the left atrium of the heart.
40. **Describe gas exchange at high altitude.**
    At high altitude, the lower atmospheric pressure means a lower partial pressure of oxygen (PO₂). This reduces the PO₂ gradient between the alveoli and blood, making gas exchange less efficient. The body compensates by increasing ventilation and 2,3-BPG production.
41. **Compare spirometry parameters.**
    Spirometry measures various lung volumes and capacities. Key parameters include FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second), FVC (forced vital capacity), and the FEV1/FVC ratio. These are used to differentiate between obstructive (low FEV1/FVC) and restrictive (low FVC, normal FEV1/FVC) lung diseases.
42. **Explain the ventilation-perfusion relationship.**
    The ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) ratio describes the balance between alveolar ventilation (V) and pulmonary blood flow (Q). An ideal V/Q ratio ensures efficient gas exchange. Mismatches (e.g., high V/Q in embolism, low V/Q in pneumonia) impair gas exchange.
43. **Describe respiratory failure types.**
    Respiratory failure is broadly classified into two types: Type I (hypoxemic) characterized by low PO₂ with normal or low PCO₂, often due to V/Q mismatch or shunt; and Type II (hypercapnic) characterized by high PCO₂ and low PO₂, usually due to hypoventilation.
44. **Compare COPD and asthma.**
    COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) is a progressive, irreversible airflow limitation, primarily caused by smoking, encompassing emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Asthma is a reversible airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness, often triggered by allergens, leading to episodic bronchoconstriction.
45. **Explain oxygen therapy principles.**
    Oxygen therapy involves administering supplemental oxygen to patients with hypoxemia to increase arterial PO₂. Principles include using the lowest effective dose, monitoring oxygen saturation, and considering potential risks like oxygen toxicity in certain conditions (e.g., COPD).
46. **Describe mechanical ventilation basics.**
    Mechanical ventilation is a life-support technique that uses a machine (ventilator) to assist or replace spontaneous breathing. It delivers positive pressure to inflate the lungs, ensuring adequate oxygenation and CO₂ removal, and can be invasive (via endotracheal tube) or non-invasive.
47. **Compare arterial blood gas parameters.**
    Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis measures pH, PCO₂, PO₂, and bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) in arterial blood. pH indicates acidity/alkalinity, PCO₂ reflects respiratory component, and HCO₃⁻ reflects metabolic component. PO₂ indicates oxygenation status.
48. **Explain pulse oximetry principles.**
    Pulse oximetry is a non-invasive method to measure oxygen saturation (SpO₂) in arterial blood. It works by emitting light at two different wavelengths (red and infrared) through a pulsating arterial bed and measuring the absorption, which differs between oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin.
49. **Describe respiratory muscle function.**
    The diaphragm and external intercostal muscles are primary inspiratory muscles, contracting to increase thoracic volume. During quiet expiration, these muscles relax. Forced expiration involves contraction of internal intercostal and abdominal muscles to actively decrease thoracic volume.
50. **Compare lung compliance and elastance.**
    Lung compliance is the ease with which the lungs can be stretched or distended (change in volume per unit change in pressure). Elastance is the reciprocal of compliance, representing the lung's ability to recoil to its original shape after being stretched. Emphysema increases compliance, while fibrosis decreases it.
51. **Explain diffusion capacity measurement.**
    Diffusion capacity (DLCO) measures the ability of gases to diffuse from the alveoli into the blood. It is typically measured using a small, known concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) in a single breath. A reduced DLCO indicates impaired gas exchange, as seen in emphysema or pulmonary fibrosis.
52. **Describe bronchodilator mechanisms.**
    Bronchodilators are medications that relax the smooth muscles of the airways, widening them and reducing airflow resistance. Common mechanisms include beta-2 adrenergic agonists (e.g., salbutamol) that stimulate receptors to cause bronchodilation, and anticholinergics (e.g., ipratropium) that block bronchoconstrictive signals.
53. **Compare upper and lower respiratory tract infections.**
    Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) affect the nose, pharynx, and larynx (e.g., common cold, sinusitis, pharyngitis). Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) affect the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and lungs (e.g., bronchitis, pneumonia, influenza), often more severe.
54. **Explain cor pulmonale development.**
    Cor pulmonale is right-sided heart failure caused by chronic lung disease or pulmonary hypertension. Chronic hypoxia from lung disease leads to pulmonary vasoconstriction, increasing pulmonary artery pressure. This increased afterload on the right ventricle causes it to hypertrophy and eventually fail.
55. **Describe pulmonary embolism pathophysiology.**
    Pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs when a blood clot (embolus), usually from deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the legs, travels to the pulmonary arteries, blocking blood flow to a portion of the lung. This leads to V/Q mismatch, impaired gas exchange, and potentially right heart strain.
56. **Compare pneumothorax types.**
    Pneumothorax is the presence of air in the pleural space, causing lung collapse. Spontaneous pneumothorax occurs without obvious cause (primary) or due to underlying lung disease (secondary). Traumatic pneumothorax results from chest injury, and tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening condition where air enters but cannot leave the pleural space, building pressure.
57. **Explain pleural effusion causes.**
    Pleural effusion is the accumulation of excess fluid in the pleural space. Causes include increased hydrostatic pressure (e.g., heart failure), decreased oncotic pressure (e.g., liver disease), increased capillary permeability (e.g., inflammation, infection), or impaired lymphatic drainage (e.g., malignancy).
58. **Describe lung cancer screening.**
    Lung cancer screening aims to detect lung cancer early in high-risk individuals before symptoms appear. Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is the recommended screening method for current or former heavy smokers aged 50-80, significantly reducing mortality.
59. **Compare smoking effects on lungs.**
    Smoking causes extensive damage to the lungs, leading to chronic inflammation, destruction of alveolar walls (emphysema), increased mucus production (chronic bronchitis), and impaired ciliary function. It is the leading cause of COPD and significantly increases the risk of lung cancer and other respiratory infections.
60. **Explain respiratory rehabilitation principles.**
    Respiratory rehabilitation is a comprehensive program for patients with chronic respiratory diseases, aiming to improve symptoms, exercise tolerance, and quality of life. Principles include exercise training, education on disease management, nutritional counseling, and psychological support.
61. **Describe exercise effects on respiration.**
    During exercise, respiratory rate and tidal volume increase significantly to meet the increased metabolic demand for oxygen and remove excess CO₂. This is mediated by neural and chemical stimuli, including increased PCO₂, H⁺, and body temperature, and proprioceptor input from muscles.
62. **Compare normal aging and lung function.**
    With normal aging, lung function gradually declines. There is a decrease in lung elasticity, weakening of respiratory muscles, reduced vital capacity, increased residual volume, and decreased efficiency of gas exchange. The immune response in the lungs also weakens, increasing susceptibility to infections.
63. **Explain pediatric respiratory differences.**
    Pediatric respiratory systems differ from adults with smaller airways, less developed cartilage, higher metabolic rates, and a greater reliance on the diaphragm for breathing. These differences make infants and young children more susceptible to respiratory distress and infections.
64. **Describe maternal respiratory changes.**
    During pregnancy, maternal respiratory changes include increased tidal volume, increased minute ventilation, and a slight decrease in functional residual capacity. These adaptations are driven by hormonal changes (progesterone) and the growing uterus, aiming to meet the increased oxygen demand of the mother and fetus.
65. **Compare pollutant effects on lungs.**
    Various air pollutants (e.g., particulate matter, ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides) can irritate airways, cause inflammation, impair lung function, and exacerbate existing respiratory conditions like asthma and COPD. Long-term exposure can lead to chronic lung diseases and cancer.
66. **Explain respiratory protective equipment.**
    Respiratory protective equipment (RPE) includes devices like respirators and masks designed to protect individuals from inhaling hazardous airborne contaminants (e.g., dust, fumes, gases). They work by filtering particles or supplying clean air, crucial in occupational settings.
67. **Describe pulmonary function test interpretation.**
    Pulmonary function tests (PFTs), including spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusion capacity, are interpreted to assess lung health. Patterns of results help diagnose and differentiate between obstructive (e.g., reduced FEV1/FVC) and restrictive (e.g., reduced TLC) lung diseases, and monitor disease progression.
68. **Compare bronchial and alveolar breath sounds.**
    Bronchial breath sounds are loud, high-pitched, and heard over the trachea and main bronchi, with expiration longer than inspiration. Alveolar (vesicular) breath sounds are soft, low-pitched, and heard over most of the lung fields, with inspiration longer than expiration. Abnormal sounds indicate pathology.
69. **Explain respiratory physical examination.**
    A respiratory physical examination involves inspection (observing breathing pattern, chest shape), palpation (feeling for tenderness, fremitus), percussion (tapping the chest to assess underlying tissue density), and auscultation (listening to breath sounds with a stethoscope) to assess lung and airway health.
70. **Describe chest X-ray interpretation basics.**
    Chest X-ray interpretation involves systematically evaluating the airways, bones, cardiac silhouette, diaphragm, effusions, fields (lung parenchyma), and great vessels (ABCDEFG mnemonic). It helps identify conditions like pneumonia, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and some lung masses.
71. **Compare CT and MRI in lung imaging.**
    Computed Tomography (CT) provides detailed cross-sectional images of the lungs, excellent for visualizing lung parenchyma, nodules, and masses. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is less commonly used for lung parenchyma due to motion artifacts but is superior for evaluating soft tissues, mediastinal structures, and vascular abnormalities.
72. **Explain bronchoscopy procedure.**
    Bronchoscopy is a procedure where a thin, flexible tube (bronchoscope) with a camera is inserted through the nose or mouth into the airways to visualize the trachea and bronchi. It is used for diagnosis (biopsy, lavage) and therapeutic interventions (mucus removal, foreign body extraction).
73. **Describe respiratory medication delivery.**
    Respiratory medications are delivered via various routes, including oral, intravenous, and inhaled. Inhaled delivery (e.g., metered-dose inhalers, nebulizers, dry powder inhalers) is preferred for many lung conditions as it delivers the drug directly to the airways, minimizing systemic side effects.
74. **Compare inhaler types and techniques.**
    Common inhaler types include metered-dose inhalers (MDIs), which require coordination between actuation and inhalation, often used with spacers; and dry powder inhalers (DPIs), which are breath-activated. Proper technique is crucial for effective drug delivery and patient education is vital.
75. **Explain respiratory emergency management.**
    Respiratory emergency management involves rapid assessment, ensuring airway patency, providing supplemental oxygen, and addressing the underlying cause. This may include bronchodilators for asthma, chest tube insertion for pneumothorax, or mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure.
76. **Describe artificial respiration techniques.**
    Artificial respiration techniques include mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, bag-mask ventilation, and mechanical ventilation. These methods provide positive pressure to inflate the lungs and deliver oxygen when spontaneous breathing is inadequate or absent.
77. **Compare oxygen concentrators and cylinders.**
    Oxygen concentrators extract oxygen from ambient air, providing a continuous supply, suitable for home use. Oxygen cylinders store compressed oxygen, offering portability and higher flow rates, often used for acute needs or travel. Both deliver supplemental oxygen.
78. **Explain respiratory isolation precautions.**
    Respiratory isolation precautions are measures taken to prevent the spread of airborne or droplet-transmitted respiratory infections. This includes placing patients in private rooms, using N95 respirators for airborne pathogens (e.g., TB), and surgical masks for droplet pathogens (e.g., influenza).
79. **Describe lung transplantation indications.**
    Lung transplantation is a surgical procedure to replace diseased lungs with healthy donor lungs. Indications include end-stage lung diseases like severe COPD, cystic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension, when other medical therapies have failed and life expectancy is limited.
80. **Compare respiratory system development.**
    The respiratory system develops from the foregut endoderm, with branching morphogenesis forming the bronchial tree and alveoli. Key stages include embryonic, pseudoglandular, canalicular, saccular, and alveolar stages, with surfactant production beginning in the canalicular stage and mature alveoli forming postnatally.
81. **Explain respiratory hormone regulation.**
    While not directly regulated by hormones in the same way as other systems, respiratory function can be influenced by hormones. For example, progesterone increases respiratory drive during pregnancy, and thyroid hormones can affect metabolic rate and thus oxygen demand.
82. **Describe respiratory reflexes.**
    Respiratory reflexes are involuntary responses that modify breathing. Examples include the Hering-Breuer reflex (prevents overinflation), cough reflex (expels irritants), sneeze reflex, and chemoreceptor reflexes (adjust breathing based on O₂, CO₂, H⁺ levels).
83. **Compare voluntary and involuntary breathing.**
    Involuntary breathing is controlled by the brainstem (medulla and pons) to maintain homeostasis, ensuring adequate gas exchange without conscious effort. Voluntary breathing allows conscious control over breathing (e.g., holding breath, speaking), originating from the cerebral cortex, but is overridden by involuntary control if vital parameters are threatened.
84. **Explain respiratory adaptation mechanisms.**
    Respiratory adaptation mechanisms allow the body to adjust to changing demands or environments. Examples include acclimatization to high altitude (increased ventilation, 2,3-BPG, erythropoiesis) and adaptations to exercise (increased respiratory rate and depth, improved efficiency).
85. **Describe respiratory system integration.**
    The respiratory system is highly integrated with other body systems. It works closely with the cardiovascular system for gas transport, the nervous system for control, the renal system for acid-base balance, and the immune system for defense against pathogens.
86. **Compare species differences in respiration.**
    Respiratory systems vary across species based on their environment and metabolic needs. For example, fish use gills for aquatic respiration, insects use tracheae, and birds have a highly efficient unidirectional airflow system with air sacs, unlike the bidirectional flow in mammals.
87. **Explain evolutionary respiratory adaptations.**
    Evolutionary respiratory adaptations include the development of lungs for terrestrial life, the highly efficient avian respiratory system for flight, and specialized structures like gills in aquatic organisms. These adaptations optimize gas exchange for specific environments and metabolic demands.
88. **Describe respiratory system disorders classification.**
    Respiratory system disorders are broadly classified into obstructive (airflow limitation, e.g., asthma, COPD), restrictive (reduced lung volumes, e.g., fibrosis), vascular (affecting pulmonary circulation, e.g., PE), infectious (e.g., pneumonia, TB), and neoplastic (cancers).
89. **Compare acute and chronic respiratory conditions.**
    Acute respiratory conditions (e.g., acute bronchitis, pneumonia) have a sudden onset and are typically short-lived. Chronic respiratory conditions (e.g., COPD, asthma, pulmonary fibrosis) are long-lasting, often progressive, and require ongoing management.
90. **Explain respiratory pharmacology basics.**
    Respiratory pharmacology involves the study of drugs used to treat respiratory diseases. Key drug classes include bronchodilators (relax airways), anti-inflammatory agents (reduce inflammation), mucolytics (thin mucus), and antibiotics/antivirals (treat infections).
91. **Describe respiratory system anatomy variations.**
    While the basic anatomy is consistent, variations can occur, such as accessory fissures in the lungs, variations in bronchial branching patterns, or congenital anomalies like tracheal agenesis. These variations can be clinically significant and impact disease presentation or surgical approaches.
92. **Compare male and female respiratory differences.**
    Males generally have larger lung volumes and capacities than females, even when adjusted for body size. Females tend to have smaller airways, which may contribute to differences in susceptibility to certain respiratory conditions and responses to exercise.
93. **Explain respiratory system embryology.**
    The respiratory system begins to develop around the 4th week of gestation from the foregut. The laryngotracheal groove forms, leading to the development of the larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs through a process of branching morphogenesis and differentiation of epithelial and mesenchymal cells.
94. **Describe respiratory system histology.**
    The respiratory system histology varies along its length. The conducting zone is lined by pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium with goblet cells (producing mucus). The respiratory zone (alveoli) is lined by thin type I pneumocytes (gas exchange) and cuboidal type II pneumocytes (surfactant production).
95. **Compare respiratory system physiology.**
    Respiratory physiology encompasses the mechanisms of breathing (ventilation), gas exchange (diffusion), and gas transport. It involves the interplay of pressure gradients, lung mechanics (compliance, elastance), and the regulation of breathing by neural and chemical factors.
96. **Explain respiratory system pathology.**
    Respiratory system pathology involves the study of diseases affecting the respiratory tract. This includes inflammatory conditions (e.g., bronchitis), infections (e.g., pneumonia), obstructive diseases (e.g., emphysema), restrictive diseases (e.g., fibrosis), and neoplasms (e.g., lung cancer).
97. **Describe respiratory system biochemistry.**
    Respiratory system biochemistry involves the metabolic processes related to gas exchange and transport. Key aspects include the biochemistry of hemoglobin-oxygen binding, the carbonic anhydrase reaction for CO₂ transport, and the synthesis and function of surfactant.
98. **Compare respiratory system genetics.**
    Respiratory system genetics explores the role of inherited factors in respiratory diseases. Genetic predispositions can influence susceptibility to asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, impacting disease severity and progression.
99. **Explain respiratory system immunology.**
    Respiratory system immunology focuses on the immune defenses of the airways and lungs against pathogens and environmental irritants. This includes innate immunity (mucociliary escalator, macrophages) and adaptive immunity (lymphocytes, antibodies) to protect against infections and mediate allergic responses.
100. **Describe respiratory system research methods.**
    Respiratory system research methods include in vitro studies (cell cultures), in vivo animal models, clinical trials (testing new therapies), epidemiological studies (identifying risk factors), and advanced imaging techniques (CT, MRI, PET) to understand disease mechanisms and develop new treatments.
## Section D: Answers

1.  **Pathway of Air:** Air enters via nostrils/mouth, passes through pharynx, larynx (voice box), trachea (windpipe), bronchi, bronchioles, and finally reaches the alveoli (air sacs) where gas exchange occurs.
2.  **Mechanism of Breathing:** Involves inspiration (active, diaphragm and external intercostals contract, increasing thoracic volume, decreasing pressure, drawing air in) and expiration (passive, muscles relax, thoracic volume decreases, increasing pressure, expelling air). Nervous control from medulla oblongata regulates rhythm.
3.  **Oxygen-Hemoglobin Dissociation Curve:** Sigmoid (S-shaped) curve showing Hb saturation with O₂ at various PO₂. Factors shifting it right (decreased O₂ affinity) include increased temperature, PCO₂, H⁺ (decreased pH), and 2,3-BPG. Physiologically, a right shift aids O₂ release at tissues, while a left shift (increased O₂ affinity) aids O₂ loading at lungs.
4.  **Alveolar Gas Exchange:** Occurs by simple diffusion across the thin respiratory membrane (alveolar and capillary walls). Factors affecting diffusion rates include partial pressure gradients (primary), thickness of membrane, surface area, and solubility of gases.
5.  **Carbon Dioxide Transport:** CO₂ is transported in three main forms:
    *   **Dissolved in plasma (7-10%):** Directly dissolved in blood plasma.
    *   **As bicarbonate ions (70%):** CO₂ reacts with water to form carbonic acid (H₂CO₃), which dissociates into H⁺ and HCO₃⁻. HCO₃⁻ moves into plasma.
    *   **As carbaminohemoglobin (20-25%):** CO₂ binds directly to amino groups of hemoglobin.
6.  **Chloride Shift (Hamburger Effect):** In tissues, as HCO₃⁻ moves out of RBCs into plasma, Cl⁻ ions move into RBCs to maintain electrical neutrality. In lungs, this process reverses: HCO₃⁻ moves back into RBCs, Cl⁻ moves out, facilitating CO₂ release. Physiologically important for efficient CO₂ transport and maintaining blood pH.
7.  **Bohr and Haldane Effects:**
    *   **Bohr Effect:** Increased CO₂ and H⁺ (decreased pH) decrease hemoglobin's affinity for O₂, promoting O₂ release in tissues.
    *   **Haldane Effect:** Deoxygenated hemoglobin has a higher affinity for CO₂ and H⁺ than oxyhemoglobin, facilitating CO₂ uptake in tissues and O₂ release. In lungs, O₂ binding to Hb releases CO₂ and H⁺.
8.  **Regulation of Breathing:** Primarily controlled by respiratory centers in the medulla oblongata and pons. Medullary rhythmicity center sets basic rhythm. Pneumotaxic and apneustic centers in pons modify it. Chemoreceptors (central in medulla, peripheral in carotid/aortic bodies) sense changes in PCO₂, H⁺, and PO₂ (less sensitive to O₂), sending signals to adjust breathing rate and depth.
9.  **Lung Volumes and Capacities:**
    *   **Tidal Volume (TV):** Volume of air inhaled/exhaled in normal breath (~500 mL).
    *   **Inspiratory Reserve Volume (IRV):** Max air inhaled after normal inspiration (~2500-3000 mL).
    *   **Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV):** Max air exhaled after normal expiration (~1000-1100 mL).
    *   **Residual Volume (RV):** Air remaining in lungs after max exhalation (~1100-1200 mL).
    *   **Inspiratory Capacity (IC):** TV + IRV.
    *   **Functional Residual Capacity (FRC):** ERV + RV.
    *   **Vital Capacity (VC):** IRV + TV + ERV.
    *   **Total Lung Capacity (TLC):** VC + RV.
    *   **Clinical Significance:** Used to diagnose and monitor respiratory diseases.
10. **Pathophysiology of Asthma:** Chronic inflammatory disease of airways characterized by bronchial hyperresponsiveness, reversible airflow obstruction, and inflammation. Causes include allergens, irritants, exercise. Mechanisms involve mast cell degranulation, mediator release, bronchoconstriction, mucus production, and airway edema. Symptoms: wheezing, cough, dyspnea, chest tightness. Treatment: bronchodilators, anti-inflammatory drugs (corticosteroids).
11. **Emphysema:** Chronic lung disease characterized by irreversible enlargement of airspaces distal to terminal bronchioles, with destruction of alveolar walls. Causes: primarily smoking, also genetic (alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency). Pathological changes: loss of elastic recoil, reduced surface area for gas exchange, air trapping. Symptoms: dyspnea, barrel chest. Prevention: smoking cessation.
12. **Hemoglobin Structure and Function:** Hemoglobin (Hb) is a tetrameric protein in RBCs, composed of four globin chains (typically two alpha, two beta) each containing a heme group with a central ferrous iron (Fe²⁺). Function: primarily transports O₂ from lungs to tissues (as oxyhemoglobin) and plays a role in CO₂ transport (as carbaminohemoglobin and buffering H⁺).
13. **Occupational Respiratory Disorders:** Lung diseases caused by inhaling dusts, chemicals, or fumes in the workplace. Types: pneumoconioses (e.g., silicosis from silica, asbestosis from asbestos, coal worker's pneumoconiosis from coal dust), occupational asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Causes: specific workplace exposures. Pathological changes: inflammation, fibrosis, airway obstruction. Prevention: engineering controls, PPE, medical surveillance.
14. **Effects of Altitude on Respiration:** At high altitude, atmospheric PO₂ decreases, leading to hypoxemia. Physiological adaptations: increased ventilation (hyperventilation), increased erythropoietin production leading to increased RBCs and hemoglobin, increased 2,3-BPG (right shift of ODC), increased pulmonary vasoconstriction. Altitude sickness (acute mountain sickness, HAPE, HACE) can occur due to inadequate acclimatization.
15. **Role of Surfactant:** Pulmonary surfactant is a lipoprotein complex produced by Type II alveolar cells. Function: reduces surface tension in alveoli, preventing their collapse during expiration and reducing the work of breathing. Clinical significance: deficiency causes Infant Respiratory Distress Syndrome (IRDS) in premature babies.
16. **Carbon Monoxide Poisoning:** CO has an affinity for hemoglobin 200-250 times greater than O₂. It binds to Hb to form carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), which cannot carry O₂. It also shifts the ODC left, impairing O₂ release from remaining oxyhemoglobin. Symptoms: headache, nausea, dizziness, cherry-red skin (late sign). Treatment: 100% O₂, hyperbaric O₂. Prevention: CO detectors.
17. **Pulmonary Gas Exchange:** The process of O₂ loading into blood and CO₂ unloading from blood in the lungs. O₂ diffuses from alveoli (high PO₂) to pulmonary capillaries (low PO₂) and CO₂ diffuses from pulmonary capillaries (high PCO₂) to alveoli (low PCO₂). Factors: large alveolar surface area, thin respiratory membrane, favorable partial pressure gradients, and matching ventilation-perfusion.
18. **Pleural Cavity Structure and Function:** The pleural cavity is the potential space between the visceral pleura (covering lung surface) and parietal pleura (lining thoracic wall). Contains a thin layer of pleural fluid. Function: pleural fluid lubricates surfaces, allowing lungs to slide smoothly during breathing, and creates a negative intrapleural pressure that keeps the lungs expanded. Clinical significance: pleural effusion (fluid accumulation), pneumothorax (air in cavity).
19. **Respiratory Failure:** Inability of the respiratory system to maintain adequate gas exchange. Types: Hypoxemic (low O₂) and Hypercapnic (high CO₂). Causes: impaired ventilation, impaired diffusion, V/Q mismatch. Management: O₂ therapy, mechanical ventilation, treating underlying cause.
20. **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD):** Persistent airflow limitation, usually progressive, associated with chronic inflammatory response to noxious particles/gases.
