## Section D: Long Answer Questions (3 marks each)

1.  Plant tissues are broadly classified into meristematic and permanent tissues. Meristematic tissues are actively dividing and are responsible for growth. They are further classified into apical, intercalary, and lateral meristems. Permanent tissues are derived from meristematic tissues and have lost the ability to divide. They are classified into simple tissues (parenchyma, collenchyma, sclerenchyma) and complex tissues (xylem, phloem).
2.  Meristematic tissues are composed of actively dividing, undifferentiated cells. Apical meristems are located at the tips of roots and shoots and are responsible for primary growth. Intercalary meristems are found in grasses and are responsible for the growth of internodes. Lateral meristems, such as the vascular cambium and cork cambium, are responsible for secondary growth.
3.  Parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma are three types of simple permanent tissues. Parenchyma cells are thin-walled and are involved in storage and photosynthesis. Collenchyma cells have thickened corners and provide mechanical support to growing parts. Sclerenchyma cells have thick, lignified walls and provide mechanical support to mature parts.
4.  Xylem is a complex tissue that conducts water and minerals from the roots to the rest of the plant. It is composed of four elements: tracheids, vessels, xylem fibres, and xylem parenchyma. Tracheids and vessels are the main water-conducting cells, while fibres provide support and parenchyma stores food.
5.  Phloem is a complex tissue that transports food materials from the leaves to other parts of the plant. It is composed of four elements: sieve tube elements, companion cells, phloem parenchyma, and phloem fibres. Sieve tube elements are the main conducting cells, while companion cells assist in their function.
6.  Dicot and monocot roots differ in several anatomical features. Dicot roots have a tap root system, fewer xylem bundles (2-4), and a small pith. Monocot roots have a fibrous root system, more xylem bundles (polyarch), and a large pith. Both have a similar arrangement of tissues, including an epidermis, cortex, endodermis, and stele.
7.  A dicot root has an epidermis with root hairs, a cortex of parenchyma, an endodermis with Casparian strips, and a stele. The stele consists of a pericycle, radial vascular bundles (2-4 xylem and phloem patches), and a small pith. The xylem is exarch.
8.  A monocot root has a similar anatomy to a dicot root, but it has more than six xylem bundles (polyarch condition) and a large, well-developed pith. It does not undergo secondary growth.
9.  A dicot stem has an epidermis, a cortex divided into a collenchymatous hypodermis, parenchymatous cortical layers, and an endodermis. The stele has vascular bundles arranged in a ring, which are conjoint, collateral, and open. There is a large pith in the center.
10. A monocot stem has a sclerenchymatous hypodermis, scattered vascular bundles, and a large parenchymatous ground tissue. The vascular bundles are conjoint, collateral, and closed. The pith is not distinct.
11. Dicot and monocot stems differ in the arrangement of their vascular bundles. Dicot stems have vascular bundles in a ring and are open, allowing for secondary growth. Monocot stems have scattered vascular bundles and are closed, so they do not undergo secondary growth.
12. A dicot leaf is dorsiventral and has an upper and lower epidermis. The mesophyll is differentiated into an upper palisade parenchyma, which is the main photosynthetic tissue, and a lower spongy parenchyma with air spaces for gas exchange.
13. A monocot leaf is isobilateral and has stomata on both surfaces. The mesophyll is not differentiated into palisade and spongy parenchyma. It may have bulliform cells that help in the rolling of the leaf.
14. Dicot and monocot leaves differ in their symmetry, stomatal distribution, and mesophyll differentiation. Dicot leaves are dorsiventral with more stomata on the lower surface and a differentiated mesophyll. Monocot leaves are isobilateral with stomata on both surfaces and an undifferentiated mesophyll.
15. Secondary growth in a dicot stem is the increase in girth due to the activity of the vascular cambium. The cambium produces secondary xylem to the inside and secondary phloem to the outside. This process is significant for providing support and increasing the conductive capacity of the stem.
16. Annual rings are formed due to the seasonal activity of the vascular cambium. The springwood, with larger vessels, and the autumnwood, with smaller vessels, together form an annual ring. The number of annual rings can be used to determine the age of a tree.
17. Vascular bundles can be radial (in roots), with xylem and phloem on different radii, or conjoint (in stems), with xylem and phloem on the same radius. Conjoint bundles can be collateral (phloem on one side of xylem) or bicollateral (phloem on both sides of xylem).
