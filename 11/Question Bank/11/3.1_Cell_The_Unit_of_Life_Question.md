## Section C: Medium Answer Questions

1. **Cell Theory:** The cell theory, proposed by Schleiden and Schwann and modified by Virchow, has two main postulates. First, all living organisms are composed of one or more cells and the products of cells. Second, all cells arise from pre-existing cells (*Omnis cellula-e cellula*).
2. **Prokaryotic vs. Eukaryotic Cells:** Prokaryotic cells lack a membrane-bound nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, with their genetic material in a nucleoid region. Eukaryotic cells have a true nucleus enclosed by a membrane and contain various organelles like mitochondria and ER.
3. **Plasma Membrane Structure:** According to the fluid mosaic model, the plasma membrane is a quasi-fluid lipid bilayer. It has hydrophilic heads facing outwards and hydrophobic tails facing inwards. Proteins are embedded within this layer (integral) or are on the surface (peripheral).
4. **Passive Transport:** This is the movement of substances across the membrane without energy expenditure, following the concentration gradient. Examples include simple diffusion of small, nonpolar molecules and osmosis, the specific movement of water across the membrane.
5. **Active vs. Passive Transport:** Passive transport does not require energy and moves substances down their concentration gradient. Active transport requires energy (ATP) to move substances against their concentration gradient, using carrier proteins.
6. **Rough ER:** Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER) is a network of membranes studded with ribosomes on its surface. Its primary function is the synthesis and modification of proteins that are destined for secretion or for insertion into membranes.
7. **Smooth ER in Animal Cells:** Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (SER) lacks ribosomes. In animal cells, it is the major site for synthesizing lipids, including steroids. For example, lipid-like steroidal hormones are synthesized in the SER.
8. **Golgi Apparatus:** The Golgi apparatus consists of a stack of flattened, membrane-bound sacs called cisternae. It functions as the cell's post office, receiving proteins and lipids from the ER, and then modifying, sorting, and packaging them into vesicles for transport to other destinations.
9. **Lysosomes as Suicidal Bags:** Lysosomes are membrane-bound vesicles filled with powerful hydrolytic enzymes. If a cell is damaged or old, the lysosomal membrane can rupture, releasing these enzymes, which then digest the entire cell. This process of cellular self-destruction gives them their nickname.
10. **Mitochondria Structure:** Mitochondria are double-membraned organelles. The outer membrane is smooth, while the inner membrane is highly folded into structures called cristae. The space inside the inner membrane is the matrix. They contain their own DNA and 70S ribosomes.
11. **Types of Plastids:** Plastids are found in plant cells and can be classified into three types based on their pigments. Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll for photosynthesis. Chromoplasts contain carotenoids, giving yellow/orange/red colors. Leucoplasts are colorless and store nutrients.
12. **Chloroplasts vs. Mitochondria:** Both are double-membraned organelles involved in energy conversion and contain their own DNA. However, chloroplasts are sites of photosynthesis (converting light to chemical energy) and are found in plants, while mitochondria are sites of aerobic respiration (releasing chemical energy) and are found in most eukaryotes.
13. **Ribosome Structure:** Ribosomes are non-membranous organelles made of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins. They consist of two subunits, a large and a small one. Eukaryotic ribosomes are 80S, while prokaryotic ribosomes are 70S.
14. **Cytoskeleton Components:** The cytoskeleton is a network of protein filaments. Its main components are microtubules (made of tubulin), microfilaments (made of actin), and intermediate filaments. These provide mechanical support, maintain cell shape, and enable cell motility.
15. **Cilia vs. Flagella:** Both are hair-like outgrowths involved in movement, with a core of microtubules in a '9+2' arrangement. Cilia are short and numerous, moving in a coordinated wave-like motion. Flagella are longer, usually found singly or in pairs, and move in a whip-like fashion.
16. **Centrosome Structure:** The centrosome is an organelle found in animal cells, typically located near the nucleus. It consists of two cylindrical structures called centrioles, arranged perpendicularly to each other, and surrounded by an amorphous mass of protein called the pericentriolar material.
17. **Nucleus Components:** The nucleus is the control center of the eukaryotic cell. It is enclosed by a double membrane (nuclear envelope) and contains the cell's genetic material in the form of chromatin. It also contains a dense structure called the nucleolus, which is the site of ribosome synthesis.
18. **Types of Chromosomes:** Chromosomes are classified based on the position of the centromere. A metacentric chromosome has a central centromere. A sub-metacentric chromosome has the centromere slightly off-center. An acrocentric chromosome has it near one end, and a telocentric chromosome has it at the very tip.
19. **Fluid Mosaic Model:** Proposed by Singer and Nicolson, this model describes the plasma membrane as a dynamic, fluid structure. The lipids and proteins are not fixed in place but can move laterally. This fluidity is crucial for membrane functions like transport and signaling.
20. **Osmosis:** Osmosis is the passive movement of water across a selectively permeable membrane from an area of high water potential (low solute concentration) to an area of low water potential (high solute concentration). It is a critical process for maintaining water balance in cells.
21. **Endomembrane System:** This is a group of organelles in eukaryotic cells that work together to modify, package, and transport lipids and proteins. It includes the nuclear envelope, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and vacuoles. These components are connected either directly or through vesicle transport.
22. **Vacuoles in Plants:** The large central vacuole in a plant cell is crucial for maintaining turgor pressure against the cell wall, which supports the plant. It also serves as a storage compartment for water, nutrients, ions, and waste products.
23. **Cell Wall Structure:** The cell wall is a rigid layer outside the plasma membrane. In plants, it is primarily made of cellulose, providing structural support and protection. In bacteria, it is made of peptidoglycan, and in fungi, it is made of chitin.
24. **Facilitated Diffusion:** This is a type of passive transport where substances move across the cell membrane down their concentration gradient, but require the help of a specific transmembrane protein (a channel or carrier protein). This process does not require energy.
25. **Chromatin vs. Chromosomes:** Chromatin is the complex of DNA and proteins (histones) found inside the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, appearing as a diffuse network. During cell division, this chromatin undergoes extensive coiling and condensation to form the compact, visible structures known as chromosomes.
26. **Nucleolus Structure:** The nucleolus is a dense, non-membranous structure found within the nucleus. It is rich in RNA and proteins and is the primary site of ribosome biogenesis, where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is transcribed and assembled with proteins to form ribosomal subunits.
27. **Nuclear Envelope Function:** The nuclear envelope is a double membrane that separates the contents of the nucleus from the cytoplasm. It is perforated by nuclear pores that regulate the passage of molecules like proteins and RNA, thus controlling communication between the nucleus and the rest of the cell.
28. **Types of Membrane Proteins:** There are two main types of membrane proteins. Integral proteins are embedded within the lipid bilayer, often spanning the entire membrane (transmembrane proteins). Peripheral proteins are not embedded but are loosely attached to the surface of the membrane.
29. **Selective Permeability:** This is a key property of the plasma membrane, meaning it allows some substances to cross it more easily than others. Small, nonpolar molecules can diffuse freely, while ions and larger polar molecules require transport proteins. This control is essential for maintaining the cell's internal environment.
30. **Chloroplast Structure:** Chloroplasts are double-membraned organelles. Inside the inner membrane is a fluid-filled space called the stroma, which contains stacks of flattened sacs called grana. Each granum is a stack of thylakoids, which contain the chlorophyll and are the site of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis.

31. **Cristae in Mitochondria:** The cristae are the folds of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Their function is to dramatically increase the surface area available for the electron transport chain and ATP synthase enzymes, which are embedded in this membrane, thus maximizing ATP production.
32. **Protein Synthesis:** This is the process where cells build proteins. It involves two main stages: transcription, where a gene's DNA sequence is copied into messenger RNA (mRNA) in the nucleus, and translation, where ribosomes read the mRNA and assemble amino acids into a protein chain.
33. **Transcription vs. Translation:** Transcription is the synthesis of an RNA molecule from a DNA template, occurring in the nucleus. Translation is the synthesis of a protein from an mRNA template, occurring on ribosomes in the cytoplasm. Transcription is the first step, and translation is the second.
34. **Bacterial Cell Wall:** The cell wall of most bacteria is a rigid structure made of peptidoglycan. This complex polymer provides structural integrity, protects the cell from osmotic lysis (bursting), and determines the cell shape.
35. **Turgor Pressure:** This is the pressure exerted by the fluid (cell sap in the vacuole) against the cell wall in a plant cell. It is essential for providing rigidity and support to non-woody plants and is generated by the osmotic inflow of water.
36. **Plasmolysis:** This is the process where the plasma membrane of a plant cell shrinks away from the cell wall. It occurs when the cell is placed in a hypertonic solution, causing water to leave the cell via osmosis.
37. **Endosymbiotic Theory:** This theory proposes that mitochondria and chloroplasts originated as free-living prokaryotic cells that were engulfed by an ancestral eukaryotic host cell. Instead of being digested, they formed a symbiotic relationship, eventually becoming permanent organelles.
38. **Flagella Structure:** A eukaryotic flagellum is a long, whip-like appendage composed of microtubules arranged in a characteristic "9+2" pattern (nine doublets surrounding a central pair). It is enclosed by an extension of the plasma membrane and anchored in the cell by a basal body.
39. **Peroxisomes Function:** Peroxisomes are small organelles that contain enzymes involved in various metabolic reactions. They play a key role in breaking down fatty acids and in detoxifying harmful substances, such as hydrogen peroxide, which they convert to water and oxygen.
40. **Chromatin Composition:** Chromatin is the material that makes up chromosomes in eukaryotic cells. It is a complex of DNA and proteins, primarily a group of small, basic proteins called histones, which help to package the long DNA molecule into a more compact form.
41. **Heterochromatin vs. Euchromatin:** These are two forms of chromatin. Euchromatin is loosely packed and contains genes that are actively being transcribed. Heterochromatin is tightly packed, generally transcriptionally inactive, and is often found near the centromeres and telomeres.
42. **Nuclear Pores:** These are large protein complexes that span the nuclear envelope. They act as channels that regulate the transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, allowing passage of small molecules and ions while actively transporting larger molecules like proteins and RNA.
43. **Cyclosis:** Also known as cytoplasmic streaming, cyclosis is the directed movement of cytoplasm and its contents within a cell. This circulation helps in the transport of organelles, nutrients, and other materials throughout the cell, and is particularly prominent in large plant cells.
44. **Middle Lamella Function:** The middle lamella is a layer rich in pectins (mainly calcium pectate) found between the primary walls of adjacent plant cells. Its primary function is to act as a cement, holding the cells together to form tissues.
45. **Plasmodesmata Role:** Plasmodesmata are microscopic channels that pass through the cell walls of adjacent plant cells, connecting their cytoplasm. They allow for direct cell-to-cell communication and transport of water, small solutes, and even larger molecules like proteins and RNA.
46. **Thylakoid Structure:** Thylakoids are membrane-bound compartments within chloroplasts. They consist of a thylakoid membrane surrounding a thylakoid lumen. They are often stacked into structures called grana.
47. **Grana Function:** Grana are the stacks of thylakoids within a chloroplast. They serve to increase the surface area of the thylakoid membranes, which contain the chlorophyll and protein complexes necessary for the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis.
48. **Stroma Composition:** The stroma is the colorless, fluid-filled space within the inner membrane of a chloroplast, surrounding the grana. It contains the chloroplast's DNA, ribosomes, and the enzymes required for the Calvin cycle (the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis).
49. **Centriole Structure:** A centriole is a cylindrical structure made of nine triplets of microtubules arranged in a ring. A pair of centrioles, arranged perpendicularly, forms the core of the centrosome in animal cells.
50. **Basal Body Function:** A basal body is a structure identical in form to a centriole, found at the base of eukaryotic cilia and flagella. It functions as the organizing center for the growth of the microtubules that form the core of these motile appendages.
51. **Satellite Chromosomes:** A satellite chromosome or SAT chromosome has a secondary constriction that is not the centromere. This constriction separates a small segment, the satellite, from the main body of the chromosome. The secondary constriction is often the site of the nucleolus organizer region.
52. **Histone Protein Role:** Histones are the primary proteins in chromatin. They are positively charged and bind tightly to the negatively charged DNA molecule. Their main function is to package and condense the long DNA strand into a compact structure called a nucleosome, which is the fundamental unit of chromatin.
53. **Binary Fission:** This is the primary method of asexual reproduction in prokaryotic organisms. The process involves the replication of the circular chromosome, followed by the division of the cytoplasm, resulting in two identical daughter cells.
54. **Mesosome Structure:** Mesosomes are folded invaginations of the plasma membrane observed in some prokaryotic cells. While once thought to have functions in DNA replication and cell division, they are now largely considered to be artifacts created during the chemical fixation process for electron microscopy.
55. **Plasmid Function:** Plasmids are small, circular DNA molecules separate from the main bacterial chromosome. They often carry genes that provide a selective advantage, such as antibiotic resistance, and are widely used as vectors in molecular cloning and genetic engineering.
56. **Inclusion Body Composition:** Inclusion bodies in prokaryotes are non-living aggregates of substances in the cytoplasm. They typically serve as reserve deposits and can be composed of materials like glycogen, lipids (poly-β-hydroxybutyrate), or phosphate granules (volutin).
57. **Bacterial Capsule Role:** The capsule is a polysaccharide layer that lies outside the cell envelope of some bacteria. It serves as a protective barrier against phagocytosis by host immune cells, prevents desiccation, and can help the bacterium adhere to surfaces.
58. **Pili Function:** Pili are hair-like appendages on the surface of many bacteria. They are typically longer and fewer than fimbriae. The sex pilus is essential for bacterial conjugation, the transfer of genetic material between bacterial cells.
59. **Magnetosome Structure:** Magnetosomes are membrane-bound organelles found in magnetotactic bacteria. They contain crystals of a magnetic mineral, usually magnetite (Fe3O4), which are arranged in chains, acting like a compass needle to orient the bacteria in a magnetic field.
60. **Carboxysome Function:** Carboxysomes are protein-shelled bacterial microcompartments found in many autotrophic bacteria, such as cyanobacteria. They contain enzymes involved in carbon fixation, primarily RuBisCO, and serve to concentrate CO2 to enhance the efficiency of this process.
61. **Gas Vesicle Role:** Gas vesicles are hollow, protein-walled structures found in many aquatic prokaryotes. By regulating the amount of gas within these vesicles, the organism can control its buoyancy and position itself at the optimal depth in the water column for light or nutrient availability.
62. **Glycocalyx Structure:** The glycocalyx is a general term for a layer of polysaccharides and/or proteins on the outer surface of a cell. In bacteria, it can be a well-organized capsule or a more diffuse slime layer. In animal cells, it is involved in cell recognition and adhesion.
63. **Integral vs. Peripheral Proteins:** Integral proteins are permanently embedded within the cell membrane, often spanning it completely. Peripheral proteins are temporarily attached to the surface of the membrane or to integral proteins and are more easily removed.
64. **Endocytosis:** This is a process where a cell takes in material from the outside by engulfing it with its cell membrane. The membrane folds around the substance to form a vesicle that then pinches off and moves into the cell. Phagocytosis ("cell eating") and pinocytosis ("cell drinking") are two types.
65. **Concentration Gradient:** This describes the difference in the concentration of a substance between two areas. Molecules naturally tend to move down their concentration gradient, from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, a process that releases energy.
66. **Lysosome Structure:** A lysosome is a simple, spherical organelle enclosed by a single membrane. It contains a variety of powerful hydrolytic enzymes that are active at an acidic pH, which is maintained by proton pumps in the lysosomal membrane.
67. **Hydrolytic Enzyme Function:** Hydrolytic enzymes break down complex molecules by adding water (hydrolysis). The enzymes in lysosomes can digest a wide range of macromolecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids, into their smaller building blocks.
68. **Autophagy:** This is a cellular process of self-digestion, where the cell degrades its own old or damaged components using lysosomes. It is a crucial housekeeping process for removing dysfunctional organelles and recycling cellular materials.
69. **Peroxisome Structure:** Peroxisomes are small, membrane-bound organelles that are typically spherical. They contain oxidative enzymes and, characteristically, high concentrations of catalase. They often have a dense, crystalline core of enzymes.
70. **Microtubule Function:** Microtubules are key components of the cytoskeleton. They provide structural support, act as tracks for the movement of organelles and vesicles, form the mitotic spindle during cell division, and are the core structural component of cilia and flagella.
71. **Microfilament Composition:** Microfilaments are the thinnest filaments of the cytoskeleton. They are solid rods composed of the contractile protein actin. They are involved in cell movement, muscle contraction, and maintaining cell shape.
72. **9+2 Arrangement:** This refers to the characteristic arrangement of microtubules in the core (axoneme) of eukaryotic cilia and flagella. It consists of nine pairs of microtubules arranged in a circle around a central pair of single microtubules.
73. **Smooth vs. Rough ER:** The key difference is the presence of ribosomes. Rough ER is studded with ribosomes and is involved in synthesizing and modifying proteins. Smooth ER lacks ribosomes and is involved in lipid synthesis, detoxification, and calcium storage.
74. **Golgi Apparatus Function:** The Golgi apparatus acts as a processing and packaging center. It receives proteins and lipids from the ER, modifies them (e.g., by glycosylation), sorts them, and packages them into vesicles for delivery to other organelles or for secretion from the cell.
75. **Vacuole Structure:** A vacuole is a membrane-bound sac within the cytoplasm. In mature plant cells, there is typically a large central vacuole enclosed by a membrane called the tonoplast. Animal cells may have small, temporary vacuoles.
76. **Tonoplast Function:** The tonoplast is the selectively permeable membrane that surrounds the central vacuole in a plant cell. It controls the transport of ions and other substances into and out of the vacuole, maintaining the turgor pressure and composition of the cell sap.
77. **Plant vs. Animal Vacuoles:** Plant cells typically have one large, permanent central vacuole that can occupy up to 90% of the cell volume and is crucial for turgor and storage. Animal cells, if they have vacuoles, have small, numerous, and temporary ones, often involved in endocytosis or exocytosis.
78. **Ribosome Structure:** Ribosomes are composed of two subunits (one large, one small), each made of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins. They are the sites of protein synthesis and are not enclosed by a membrane.
79. **70S Ribosome Function:** 70S ribosomes are found in prokaryotes, as well as in the mitochondria and chloroplasts of eukaryotes. Their function is to translate messenger RNA (mRNA) into protein, just like their 80S counterparts.
80. **80S Ribosome Structure:** 80S ribosomes are found in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells, either free or attached to the endoplasmic reticulum. They are larger than 70S ribosomes and are composed of 60S and 40S subunits.
81. **Free vs. Bound Ribosomes:** Free ribosomes are suspended in the cytoplasm and synthesize proteins that will function within the cytosol. Bound ribosomes are attached to the endoplasmic reticulum and synthesize proteins that are destined for insertion into membranes or for secretion from the cell.
82. **Ribosome Synthesis:** In eukaryotes, this process, called ribosome biogenesis, occurs in the nucleolus. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes are transcribed, and the rRNA is processed and assembled with ribosomal proteins (which are imported from the cytoplasm) to form the ribosomal subunits.
83. **Nucleolus Function:** The primary function of the nucleolus is ribosome biogenesis. It is the site where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is synthesized and assembled with proteins to form the large and small ribosomal subunits, which are then exported to the cytoplasm.
84. **Nuclear Envelope Structure:** The nuclear envelope is the double membrane surrounding the nucleus in eukaryotic cells. The outer membrane is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum. The envelope is perforated by nuclear pores that regulate molecular traffic.
85. **Nuclear Transport:** The movement of molecules into and out of the nucleus is tightly regulated by the nuclear pore complexes. Small molecules can diffuse freely, while large molecules like proteins and RNA require active transport, guided by specific import and export signals and transport proteins.
86. **Chromatin Organization:** Chromatin is organized into a hierarchy of levels. The basic unit is the nucleosome, where DNA is wrapped around a core of eight histone proteins. These nucleosomes are then further coiled and folded to form a compact chromatin fiber.
87. **Chromosome Structure:** A duplicated chromosome consists of two identical sister chromatids joined at a constricted region called the centromere. Each chromatid is a highly condensed and coiled molecule of chromatin (DNA and proteins).
88. **Chromosome Types by Centromere Position:** Chromosomes are classified as metacentric (centromere in the middle), sub-metacentric (off-center), acrocentric (near one end), or telocentric (at the very end), based on the position of the centromere.
89. **Karyotype:** A karyotype is the complete set of chromosomes in a species or in an individual organism, including the number of chromosomes and their appearance. It is typically represented by an image of the chromosomes arranged in homologous pairs and ordered by size.
90. **Centromere Structure:** The centromere is a constricted region of a chromosome that separates it into a short arm (p) and a long arm (q). It is the site where the kinetochore, a protein structure that attaches to spindle fibers, assembles during cell division.
91. **Spindle Fiber Function:** Spindle fibers are microtubules that form during cell division. They attach to the kinetochores of chromosomes and are responsible for aligning the chromosomes at the metaphase plate and then separating the sister chromatids or homologous chromosomes to opposite poles of the cell.
92. **Chromosome Condensation:** This is the process by which the long, thin chromatin fibers are progressively coiled and folded into the compact, visible chromosomes that are characteristic of a cell undergoing mitosis or meiosis. This condensation is essential for the orderly segregation of genetic material.
93. **Prokaryotic vs. Eukaryotic Ribosomes:** The main difference is size. Prokaryotic ribosomes are smaller (70S, with 30S and 50S subunits), while eukaryotic cytoplasmic ribosomes are larger (80S, with 40S and 60S subunits). This difference is exploited by some antibiotics that target bacterial ribosomes.
94. **Bacterial Chromosome Structure:** The chromosome of a typical bacterium is a single, circular molecule of double-stranded DNA. It is located in the cytoplasm in a region called the nucleoid and is highly coiled and compacted with the help of various proteins.
95. **Eukaryotic Chromosome Organization:** Eukaryotic chromosomes are linear molecules of double-stranded DNA that are highly organized and compacted with histone proteins to form chromatin. Each species has a characteristic number of chromosomes located within the nucleus.
96. **Telomere Function:** Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences at the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes. They protect the ends of the chromosome from deterioration or from fusing with neighboring chromosomes. They shorten with each cell division, which is linked to cellular aging.
97. **Nucleosome Structure:** A nucleosome is the fundamental subunit of chromatin. It consists of a segment of DNA wound around a core of eight histone proteins (two each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). This structure is often described as "beads on a string".
98. **Levels of Chromosome Organization:** DNA is first wrapped around histones to form nucleosomes. This "beads on a string" structure is then coiled into a 30 nm chromatin fiber. The fiber is further looped and coiled to form the highly condensed metaphase chromosome.
99. **Chromatin Remodeling:** This is the dynamic modification of chromatin architecture to allow access of condensed genomic DNA to the regulatory transcription machinery proteins, and thereby control gene expression. It involves repositioning or ejecting nucleosomes.
100. **Nuclear Matrix:** The nuclear matrix or nucleoskeleton is a network of fibers found throughout the inside of a cell nucleus. It is thought to play a role in organizing the genetic material, anchoring DNA replication and transcription machinery, and maintaining the shape of the nucleus.

## Section D: Long Answer Questions

1. **Cell Theory:** The classical cell theory was proposed by botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann in 1839. Its initial postulates were that all living things are made of cells and that the cell is the basic unit of life. In 1855, Rudolf Virchow added a third postulate, *Omnis cellula-e cellula*, meaning all cells arise from pre-existing cells. This theory is a cornerstone of modern biology, unifying the study of life by establishing the cell as the fundamental unit of structure, function, and reproduction for all living organisms.
2. **Prokaryotic vs. Eukaryotic Cells:** Prokaryotic cells are structurally simpler and smaller than eukaryotic cells. They lack a membrane-bound nucleus; their genetic material is a single circular chromosome located in a nucleoid region. They also lack other membrane-bound organelles like mitochondria or ER. Eukaryotic cells possess a true nucleus containing multiple linear chromosomes and have a complex cytoplasm with various membrane-bound organelles that perform specialized functions. Prokaryotes have 70S ribosomes, while eukaryotes have larger 80S ribosomes in the cytoplasm.
3. **Fluid Mosaic Model:** Proposed by Singer and Nicolson in 1972, this model describes the plasma membrane as a mosaic of components—phospholipids, cholesterol, and proteins—that can move fluidly. The core is a quasi-fluid phospholipid bilayer with hydrophilic heads facing the aqueous environment and hydrophobic tails facing inward. Proteins are either embedded within the bilayer (integral proteins) or attached to its surface (peripheral proteins). This fluid nature is essential for the membrane's functions, including transport, signaling, and cell-cell recognition.
4. **Membrane Transport:** Transport across the cell membrane can be passive or active. Passive transport does not require energy and follows the concentration gradient. It includes simple diffusion (movement of small, nonpolar molecules), osmosis (movement of water), and facilitated diffusion (movement of ions and polar molecules via protein channels or carriers). Active transport requires energy (ATP) to move substances against their concentration gradient, using specific protein pumps.
5. **Endomembrane System:** This is a network of internal membranes in eukaryotic cells that work together to synthesize, process, and transport proteins and lipids. It includes the nuclear envelope, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and vacuoles. The RER synthesizes proteins, which are then processed in the Golgi. Vesicles bud off the Golgi to become lysosomes or transport vesicles, demonstrating the coordinated function of the system.
6. **Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):** The ER is a vast network of membrane-enclosed sacs and tubules. Rough ER (RER) is studded with ribosomes and is the site of synthesis for proteins that will be secreted or inserted into membranes. Smooth ER (SER) lacks ribosomes and is involved in lipid synthesis, detoxification of drugs and poisons, and storage of calcium ions.
7. **Golgi Apparatus:** The Golgi apparatus, or Golgi complex, is composed of flattened membrane sacs called cisternae, stacked like pancakes. It functions as a cellular post office. It receives proteins and lipids from the ER at its *cis* face, modifies them (e.g., glycosylation), sorts them, and packages them into vesicles at its *trans* face for transport to their final destinations, either within or outside the cell.
8. **Lysosomes:** Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles containing a variety of hydrolytic enzymes that function at an acidic pH. They are the cell's digestive system, breaking down macromolecules from endocytosis, and are also involved in autophagy, the process of degrading the cell's own old or damaged organelles. Their rupture can lead to cell death, earning them the name "suicidal bags".
9. **Mitochondria:** Known as the "powerhouse of the cell," the mitochondrion is a double-membraned organelle responsible for aerobic respiration. The inner membrane is folded into cristae, which increase the surface area for the electron transport chain and ATP synthase. The mitochondrial matrix contains enzymes for the Krebs cycle. Through these processes, mitochondria convert the chemical energy in food molecules into ATP, the main energy currency of the cell.
10. **Plastids:** Plastids are organelles found in plant cells and algae. They are classified based on their pigments. Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll and are the site of photosynthesis. Chromoplasts contain carotenoid pigments and give fruits and flowers their yellow, orange, or red colors. Leucoplasts are colorless and function as storage depots for starch (amyloplasts), oils (elaioplasts), or proteins (proteinoplasts).
11. **Mitochondria vs. Chloroplasts:** Both are double-membraned organelles involved in energy conversion and contain their own circular DNA and 70S ribosomes, supporting the endosymbiotic theory. However, their functions are opposite: mitochondria perform cellular respiration, breaking down glucose to produce ATP, and are found in nearly all eukaryotes. Chloroplasts perform photosynthesis, using light energy to synthesize glucose, and are found only in plants and algae.
12. **Ribosomes:** Ribosomes are the protein factories of the cell. Composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins, they consist of a large and a small subunit. They read the genetic code transcribed onto messenger RNA (mRNA) and catalyze the assembly of amino acids into polypeptide chains, a process called translation.
13. **Cytoskeleton:** The cytoskeleton is an intricate network of protein filaments that extends throughout the cytoplasm. It is composed of three main types of fibers: microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments. It provides mechanical support, maintains the cell's shape, anchors organelles, and is crucial for cell motility and the transport of materials within the cell.
14. **Cilia and Flagella:** These are motile appendages on the surface of many cells. They share a common structure, with a core of microtubules in a "9+2" arrangement, covered by the plasma membrane. They are involved in locomotion; flagella are long and move in a whip-like motion, while cilia are short and move in a coordinated wave. They can also be used to move fluid over a cell's surface.
15. **Nucleus:** The nucleus is the most prominent organelle in a eukaryotic cell, serving as its control center. It is enclosed by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope. It contains the cell's chromosomes, which hold the genetic information (DNA). The nucleus also contains the nucleolus, where ribosomes are synthesized. It controls the cell's growth, metabolism, and reproduction by regulating gene expression.
16. **Chromosome Structure:** A chromosome is a highly organized structure of DNA and proteins that carries the genetic information of a cell. In its duplicated state, it consists of two identical sister chromatids joined at a centromere. Chromosomes are classified by the centromere's position as metacentric, sub-metacentric, acrocentric, or telocentric. The DNA is tightly coiled around histone proteins to form this compact structure.

17. **Osmosis and its Significance:** Osmosis is the net diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane from a region of higher water potential to one of lower water potential. In animal cells, it can cause them to swell (in hypotonic solutions) or shrink (in hypertonic solutions). In plant cells, the influx of water into the central vacuole creates turgor pressure against the cell wall, which is vital for providing structural support to the plant.
18. **Cell Wall Structure and Function:** The cell wall is a rigid outer layer found in plants, fungi, and bacteria. In plants, it is primarily composed of cellulose, providing structural support, preventing osmotic lysis, and protecting the cell. In bacteria, it is made of peptidoglycan, which is also crucial for maintaining shape and integrity.
19. **Selective Permeability:** This is a fundamental property of the plasma membrane, allowing it to control which substances enter and leave the cell. It is freely permeable to small, nonpolar molecules but restricts the passage of ions and large polar molecules, which require specific transport proteins. This regulation is essential for maintaining the cell's distinct internal environment (homeostasis).
20. **Vacuoles in Plant Cells:** The large central vacuole is a defining feature of mature plant cells. Enclosed by a membrane called the tonoplast, it stores water, nutrients, ions, and waste products. Its most critical role is maintaining turgor pressure by pushing the cytoplasm and plasma membrane against the cell wall, which provides rigidity to the cell and support to the plant.
21. **Endosymbiotic Theory:** This theory explains the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts. It proposes that these organelles were once free-living prokaryotic organisms that were engulfed by a larger ancestral host cell. Evidence includes their double membrane, their own circular DNA (similar to prokaryotes), their 70S ribosomes, and their ability to reproduce by binary fission independently of the cell.
22. **Photosynthesis and Chloroplasts:** Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose. This process occurs in chloroplasts. The light-dependent reactions take place in the thylakoid membranes, where chlorophyll captures light energy. The light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) occur in the stroma, where CO2 is fixed into organic molecules.
23. **Cellular Respiration and Mitochondria:** Cellular respiration is the process of breaking down glucose to produce ATP. The main stages occur in the mitochondria. The Krebs cycle takes place in the mitochondrial matrix, and the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation occur on the inner mitochondrial membrane (cristae). This process is the primary source of energy for most eukaryotic cells.
24. **Prokaryotic Genetic Material:** The genetic material of a prokaryote is typically a single, circular chromosome of double-stranded DNA. It is not enclosed in a nucleus but is located in a region of the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. It is highly compacted through supercoiling, aided by various nucleoid-associated proteins.
25. **Eukaryotic Genetic Material:** In eukaryotes, the genetic material consists of multiple, linear chromosomes of double-stranded DNA. Each chromosome is complexed with histone proteins to form chromatin, which is highly organized and compacted. This genetic material is housed within the membrane-bound nucleus.
26. **Protein Synthesis (Transcription to Translation):** This is the central dogma of molecular biology. First, in transcription, the DNA sequence of a gene is copied into a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule in the nucleus. The mRNA then travels to the cytoplasm, where, in translation, a ribosome reads the mRNA sequence and synthesizes a corresponding polypeptide chain by linking amino acids together.
27. **Nuclear Envelope and Pores:** The nuclear envelope is a double membrane that isolates the nucleus from the cytoplasm. The two membranes are fused at various points, creating nuclear pores. These pores are complex protein structures that act as regulated gateways, controlling the passage of molecules like proteins and RNA into and out of the nucleus.
28. **Nucleolus and Ribosome Synthesis:** The nucleolus is a dense region within the nucleus that serves as the ribosome factory. It is the site where genes for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) are transcribed. The newly made rRNA is then processed and assembled with ribosomal proteins (imported from the cytoplasm) to form the large and small ribosomal subunits.
29. **Chromatin and Gene Expression:** Chromatin is the complex of DNA and histone proteins. Its state of condensation plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression. Loosely packed chromatin (euchromatin) is accessible to transcription factors and RNA polymerase, allowing genes to be expressed. Tightly packed chromatin (heterochromatin) is generally inaccessible and transcriptionally silent.
30. **Chromosome Condensation:** During prophase of cell division, the long, thin chromatin fibers undergo a dramatic process of coiling and folding. This condensation, mediated by histone modifications and other proteins, compacts the DNA into the familiar, short, thick chromosomes. This process is essential for the orderly segregation of the chromosomes to the daughter cells.
31. **Centrosome and Centrioles:** The centrosome is the primary microtubule-organizing center in animal cells. It consists of two perpendicularly arranged centrioles surrounded by pericentriolar material. During cell division, the centrosome duplicates, and the two centrosomes move to opposite poles of the cell to form the mitotic spindle, which orchestrates chromosome separation.
32. **Molecular Structure of Plasma Membrane:** The plasma membrane is a fluid mosaic of lipids and proteins. The phospholipid bilayer provides the basic fluid structure. Integral proteins are embedded within it, some spanning the entire membrane (transmembrane), while peripheral proteins are attached to the surface. Cholesterol molecules are interspersed, modulating membrane fluidity.
33. **Active Transport Mechanism:** Active transport moves substances against their concentration gradient and requires energy, usually from ATP hydrolysis. A specific carrier protein binds the substance to be transported. The binding of ATP and its subsequent hydrolysis causes a conformational change in the protein, which moves the substance across the membrane.
34. **Peroxisomes in Metabolism:** Peroxisomes are small organelles containing oxidative enzymes. They are involved in the breakdown of long-chain fatty acids through beta-oxidation. A key function is detoxification; they break down harmful substances and, in the process, produce hydrogen peroxide, which is then safely converted to water and oxygen by the enzyme catalase.
35. **Turgor Pressure in Plants:** Turgor pressure is the hydrostatic pressure that builds up inside a plant cell when water enters via osmosis. This pressure pushes the plasma membrane against the rigid cell wall. It is vital for providing mechanical support to non-woody plant tissues, keeping them firm and erect.
36. **Plasmolysis in Plant Physiology:** Plasmolysis is the process where the cell contents shrink and the plasma membrane pulls away from the cell wall. This occurs when a plant cell is placed in a hypertonic solution, causing a net loss of water. Severe plasmolysis is irreversible and leads to cell death, causing plants to wilt.
37. **Cytoplasmic Streaming (Cyclosis):** This is the active movement of cytoplasm within a cell, driven by the interaction of the motor protein myosin with actin filaments of the cytoskeleton. This circulation helps distribute nutrients, metabolites, and organelles throughout the cell, which is particularly important in large cells like those of plants.
38. **Plasmodesmata in Plant Communication:** Plasmodesmata are channels that pass through the cell walls of adjacent plant cells, creating direct cytoplasmic connections. They form a continuous cytoplasmic network called the symplast. This allows for direct cell-to-cell transport of water, small solutes, signaling molecules, and even some proteins and RNA, coordinating the activities of tissues.
39. **Bacterial Cell Wall Structure:** The bacterial cell wall is a complex structure located outside the plasma membrane, primarily composed of peptidoglycan. This polymer consists of alternating sugar molecules cross-linked by short peptides, forming a strong, mesh-like layer that provides shape and protection against osmotic lysis.
40. **Bacterial Appendages:** Bacteria can have several types of appendages. Flagella are long, whip-like structures used for motility. Pili are shorter, hair-like appendages involved in bacterial conjugation (transfer of DNA). Fimbriae are also short and hair-like but are used for attachment to surfaces or host cells.
41. **Bacterial Genetic Material:** The primary genetic material of a bacterium is a single, circular chromosome located in the nucleoid region. In addition, many bacteria contain plasmids, which are small, circular, extrachromosomal DNA molecules that often carry genes for antibiotic resistance or other beneficial traits.
42. **Binary Fission:** This is the process of asexual reproduction in prokaryotes. The circular chromosome replicates, and the two copies attach to different points on the cell membrane. The cell then elongates, and a new cell wall and membrane form between the two chromosomes, dividing the cell into two identical daughter cells.
43. **Inclusion Bodies in Bacteria:** These are aggregates of reserve materials found in the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells. They are not membrane-bound and serve as storage depots. Examples include glycogen granules for energy storage, polyphosphate granules (volutin) for phosphate storage, and sulfur granules.
44. **Mesosomes in Bacteria:** Mesosomes are folded invaginations of the plasma membrane found in some bacteria. They were once thought to be involved in DNA replication, cell division, or respiration. However, they are now widely believed to be artifacts created by the chemical fixation techniques used for electron microscopy.
45. **Plasmids in Biotechnology:** Plasmids are crucial tools in genetic engineering. Because they are small, circular, and can replicate independently, they are used as vectors to carry foreign genes into bacteria. This allows for the cloning of genes and the large-scale production of proteins like insulin.
46. **Bacterial Capsule:** The capsule is a well-organized, gelatinous layer of polysaccharides that surrounds the cell wall of some bacteria. It is a major virulence factor, as it protects the bacterium from phagocytosis by the host's immune cells and helps it adhere to surfaces.
47. **Bacterial Conjugation and Pili:** Conjugation is a form of horizontal gene transfer in bacteria where genetic material is transferred from a donor cell to a recipient cell. This process is mediated by a specialized appendage called a sex pilus, which forms a bridge between the two cells, allowing for the transfer of a plasmid.
48. **Specialized Structures in Cyanobacteria:** Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic bacteria with specialized structures. They have an internal system of thylakoids for photosynthesis. Many can form heterocysts, which are specialized cells for nitrogen fixation, and some produce gas vesicles for buoyancy control in water.
49. **Thylakoid System in Chloroplasts:** The thylakoid system is an extensive internal membrane network within the chloroplast. It consists of flattened sacs (thylakoids) that are often arranged in stacks called grana. The thylakoid membranes contain the chlorophyll pigments and the protein complexes of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis.
50. **Calvin Cycle in Chloroplasts:** The Calvin cycle (light-independent reactions) is the process of carbon fixation in photosynthesis. It takes place in the stroma of the chloroplast. In this cycle, the enzyme RuBisCO captures CO2 and, using ATP and NADPH from the light reactions, converts it into glucose.
51. **Electron Transport Chain in Mitochondria:** The electron transport chain (ETC) is a series of protein complexes located in the inner mitochondrial membrane (cristae). High-energy electrons from NADH and FADH2 are passed along this chain, releasing energy. This energy is used to pump protons across the membrane, creating a proton gradient.
52. **Cristae in Mitochondria:** Cristae are the folds of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Their function is to vastly increase the surface area of this membrane. This provides more space for the components of the electron transport chain and ATP synthase, thereby enhancing the mitochondrion's capacity for ATP production.
53. **ATP Synthesis in Mitochondria:** This process, called oxidative phosphorylation, occurs on the inner mitochondrial membrane. The proton gradient created by the electron transport chain drives protons back across the membrane through an enzyme called ATP synthase. The flow of protons through ATP synthase powers the synthesis of large amounts of ATP from ADP and phosphate.
54. **Ribosomes in Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes:** Ribosomes are the sites of protein synthesis in all cells. Prokaryotic ribosomes are smaller (70S). Eukaryotic ribosomes are larger (80S) and are found free in the cytoplasm or bound to the rough ER. Mitochondria and chloroplasts in eukaryotes also contain their own 70S ribosomes.
55. **Ribosome Biogenesis:** This is the process of making ribosomes, which primarily occurs in the nucleolus of eukaryotic cells. It involves the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes and the assembly of these rRNAs with ribosomal proteins (which are synthesized in the cytoplasm and imported into the nucleus) to form the ribosomal subunits.
56. **Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER):** The RER is a network of membranes continuous with the nuclear envelope, characterized by the presence of ribosomes on its surface. Its primary role is the synthesis and modification of proteins that are destined for secretion, insertion into membranes, or delivery to certain organelles like the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes.
57. **Protein Folding in ER:** As proteins are synthesized on the RER, they enter the ER lumen, where they are folded into their correct three-dimensional shapes. This process is assisted by molecular chaperones. The ER also has a quality control system that identifies and removes misfolded proteins.
58. **Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (SER):** The SER is a network of tubular membranes that lacks ribosomes. Its functions are diverse and include the synthesis of lipids, phospholipids, and steroids. It is also involved in the detoxification of drugs and poisons (especially in liver cells) and the storage of calcium ions.
59. **Lipid Synthesis in SER:** The smooth ER is the primary site of synthesis for many lipids. Enzymes in the SER membrane synthesize fatty acids, phospholipids, and steroids. These lipids are essential components of all cellular membranes and also function as signaling molecules and hormones.
60. **Golgi in Protein Processing:** The Golgi apparatus receives newly synthesized proteins from the ER. As these proteins move through the Golgi cisternae, they are further processed and modified. A common modification is glycosylation, the addition or modification of carbohydrate chains, which is important for protein stability and targeting.
61. **Vesicle Trafficking:** The endomembrane system functions through vesicle trafficking. Transport vesicles bud off from one organelle (e.g., the ER) and move through the cytoplasm, fusing with the next organelle in the pathway (e.g., the Golgi). This process allows for the directed movement of proteins and lipids throughout the cell.
62. **Lysosomes in Digestion:** Lysosomes are the digestive compartments of the cell. They contain a wide array of hydrolytic enzymes that can break down all types of biological polymers—proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. They digest material taken up from outside the cell by endocytosis and are also involved in recycling the cell's own organic material (autophagy).
63. **Autophagy Regulation:** Autophagy is a tightly regulated process of cellular self-digestion. When a cell is under stress (e.g., starvation), a double membrane called an autophagosome forms around a portion of the cytoplasm or a damaged organelle. This autophagosome then fuses with a lysosome, and its contents are degraded and recycled.
64. **Vacuoles in Plant Cells:** The large central vacuole is a versatile organelle in plant cells. It acts as a storage site for water, nutrients, and metabolic wastes. It plays a crucial role in cell elongation during growth and is essential for maintaining turgor pressure, which provides structural support to the cell and the entire plant.
65. **Vacuole Biogenesis:** The large central vacuole in a plant cell is formed from the fusion of smaller vesicles derived from the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. The tonoplast, the vacuolar membrane, contains transport proteins that actively pump ions into the vacuole, causing water to follow by osmosis and the vacuole to expand.
66. **Cytoskeleton Organization:** The cytoskeleton is a dynamic network of protein filaments that provides a structural framework for the cell. It is composed of three main types of filaments: microtubules (hollow tubes of tubulin), microfilaments (thin, solid rods of actin), and intermediate filaments (tough, fibrous proteins).
67. **Microtubule Functions:** Microtubules are involved in a variety of cellular processes. They help maintain cell shape, provide tracks for the movement of organelles and vesicles by motor proteins, form the mitotic spindle that separates chromosomes during cell division, and are the structural core of cilia and flagella.
68. **Microfilament Structure and Function:** Microfilaments are thin, flexible fibers made of the protein actin. They are best known for their role in muscle contraction, but they are also involved in cell motility (e.g., amoeboid movement), changes in cell shape, and cytoplasmic streaming.
69. **Cytoplasmic Streaming Regulation:** Cytoplasmic streaming, or cyclosis, is the directed flow of cytoplasm within the cell. It is driven by the interaction of the motor protein myosin with bundles of actin microfilaments. This movement helps to distribute nutrients and organelles efficiently throughout the cell.
70. **Intermediate Filaments:** These are cytoskeletal components that are intermediate in diameter between microtubules and microfilaments. They are very stable and their primary function is purely structural. They form a framework that reinforces the cell and helps it withstand mechanical stress. An example is keratin in epithelial cells.
71. **Muscle Contraction:** Muscle contraction is caused by the sliding of actin microfilaments past myosin filaments. In a muscle cell, these filaments are arranged in a structure called a sarcomere. The process is driven by ATP hydrolysis, which causes the myosin heads to bind to actin and pull the filaments, shortening the sarcomere.
72. **Cilia and Flagella Structure:** These are motile appendages that extend from the surface of many eukaryotic cells. They have a core structure called the axoneme, which consists of nine pairs of microtubules arranged in a circle around a central pair (the 9+2 arrangement). This entire structure is enclosed by an extension of the plasma membrane.
73. **9+2 Arrangement:** This refers to the highly conserved arrangement of microtubules within the axoneme of eukaryotic cilia and flagella. It consists of nine doublet microtubules forming a ring around two central single microtubules. This structure is essential for the bending movements of these appendages.
74. **Ciliary and Flagellar Movement:** The movement of cilia and flagella is produced by the bending of the axoneme. This bending is driven by the motor protein dynein, which is attached to the outer microtubule doublets. Using energy from ATP, the dynein arms walk along the adjacent doublet, causing the microtubules to slide past each other and the cilium or flagellum to bend.
75. **Basal Body Structure and Function:** A basal body is a microtubule-based organelle located at the base of a cilium or flagellum. It has a structure identical to a centriole (nine triplets of microtubules with no central pair). It serves as the nucleation site for the growth of the axoneme and anchors the appendage to the cell.
76. **Centrosome Organization:** The centrosome, found in animal cells, is the main microtubule-organizing center. It consists of a pair of centrioles, arranged at right angles to each other, embedded in a mass of protein known as the pericentriolar material. The pericentriolar material contains the proteins responsible for nucleating microtubule growth.
77. **Centrosome Duplication:** The centrosome duplicates during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. The two centrioles separate, and a new daughter centriole grows at the base of each original one. At the beginning of mitosis, the two centrosomes move to opposite poles of the cell to establish the mitotic spindle.
78. **Nuclear Envelope Structure and Function:** The nuclear envelope is a double membrane that encloses the nucleus, separating its contents from the cytoplasm. The outer membrane is continuous with the ER. It is perforated by nuclear pore complexes that regulate the flow of molecules, thus protecting the cell's genetic material while allowing communication with the cytoplasm.
79. **Nuclear Transport Mechanism:** The transport of large molecules through the nuclear pore complexes is an active, regulated process. Proteins destined for the nucleus have a nuclear localization signal (NLS), which is recognized by transport proteins called importins. Similarly, molecules exiting the nucleus have a nuclear export signal (NES) recognized by exportins.
80. **Nuclear Pore Organization:** A nuclear pore is a massive, complex structure made of over 30 different proteins called nucleoporins. It forms an eight-fold symmetrical channel through the nuclear envelope. A central channel allows for the passage of molecules, and protein filaments extend into both the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm.
81. **Nuclear Matrix Function:** The nuclear matrix is a hypothetical fibrillar network within the nucleus that is thought to provide a structural framework. It is proposed to help organize chromatin into distinct territories and to anchor the machinery for DNA replication and transcription, although its exact nature and existence are still debated.
82. **Nuclear Envelope Breakdown and Reformation:** During prophase of mitosis, the nuclear envelope breaks down into small vesicles. This is triggered by the phosphorylation of nuclear lamina proteins. At the end of mitosis (telophase), the process is reversed; the vesicles reassemble around the separated chromosomes, and the nuclear pores reform.
83. **Chromatin Molecular Organization:** Chromatin is a hierarchical structure. The fundamental unit is the nucleosome, where about 147 base pairs of DNA are wrapped around a core of eight histone proteins. This "beads-on-a-string" fiber is then further coiled and looped to achieve higher levels of compaction.
84. **Nucleosome Structure and Function:** A nucleosome consists of a DNA segment wrapped around a protein core of eight histones. It is the basic unit of DNA packaging in eukaryotes. This packaging compacts the DNA and also plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression, as the accessibility of the DNA is affected by the nucleosome's position and state.
85. **Chromatin Remodeling:** This is the dynamic process of altering chromatin structure to control gene expression. Specialized protein complexes can slide, eject, or restructure nucleosomes, making the underlying DNA either more accessible or less accessible to the transcription machinery. This is a key mechanism for gene regulation.
86. **Levels of Chromosome Organization:** The organization is hierarchical. DNA is wrapped into nucleosomes. The string of nucleosomes is coiled into a 30-nm chromatin fiber. This fiber is then organized into large loops that are attached to a protein scaffold. Further coiling of these loops produces the highly condensed metaphase chromosome.
87. **Heterochromatin and Euchromatin:** These are two distinct states of chromatin. Euchromatin is less condensed and transcriptionally active, containing most of the organism's genes. Heterochromatin is highly condensed and largely transcriptionally inactive. It is often found at the centromeres and telomeres.
88. **Chromosome Condensation Mechanism:** This process, which occurs during prophase, involves multiple levels of coiling and folding. It is driven by proteins called condensins, which use ATP to create loops in the chromatin fiber. Histone modifications also play a key role in facilitating this compaction.
89. **Centromere and Kinetochore:** The centromere is the primary constriction on a chromosome, where the two sister chromatids are most closely attached. The kinetochore is a large protein complex that assembles on the centromere during cell division. It is the site where spindle microtubules attach to the chromosome.
90. **Chromosome Segregation:** This is the process during mitosis and meiosis where chromosomes are distributed to daughter cells. Spindle microtubules attach to the kinetochores of the chromosomes. During anaphase, the sister chromatids (in mitosis) or homologous chromosomes (in meiosis I) are pulled apart to opposite poles of the cell, ensuring each daughter cell receives a complete set.
91. **Telomere Structure and Function:** Telomeres are regions of repetitive nucleotide sequences at each end of a eukaryotic chromosome. They function to protect the ends of the chromosome from deterioration and from being mistaken for a DNA break by the cell's repair machinery. They shorten with each cell division, which is linked to cellular aging.
92. **DNA Replication Mechanism:** DNA replication is a semi-conservative process where each strand of the original DNA molecule serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand. The process is carried out by an enzyme called DNA polymerase, which adds nucleotides to the growing chain. It begins at specific origins of replication and proceeds bidirectionally.
93. **Transcription and RNA Processing:** Transcription is the synthesis of an RNA molecule from a DNA template by the enzyme RNA polymerase. In eukaryotes, the initial RNA transcript (pre-mRNA) undergoes processing. This includes the addition of a 5' cap and a 3' poly-A tail, and the removal of non-coding regions (introns) through a process called splicing.
94. **Translation Mechanism:** Translation is the process of protein synthesis by ribosomes. The ribosome moves along an mRNA molecule, reading its codons (three-nucleotide sequences). For each codon, a specific transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule carrying the corresponding amino acid binds, and the ribosome catalyzes the formation of a peptide bond, building a polypeptide chain.
95. **Transfer RNA (tRNA) Structure and Function:** tRNA is a small RNA molecule that acts as an adapter in protein synthesis. It has a specific three-dimensional structure with an anticodon loop that recognizes a specific codon on the mRNA. At its other end, it carries the amino acid corresponding to that codon, delivering it to the ribosome.
96. **Ribosome Assembly and Function:** Ribosomes are composed of a large and a small subunit. During translation, these subunits assemble on an mRNA molecule. The ribosome has three binding sites for tRNA (A, P, and E sites) and catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds, effectively translating the genetic code into a protein sequence.
97. **Protein Folding Mechanism:** As a polypeptide chain is synthesized, it spontaneously begins to fold into its unique three-dimensional structure, which is determined by its amino acid sequence. This process is often assisted by molecular chaperones, which help prevent misfolding and aggregation. The correct 3D structure is essential for the protein's function.
98. **Protein Targeting and Sorting:** After synthesis, proteins must be delivered to their correct destinations within the cell. This process is directed by sorting signals, which are specific amino acid sequences within the protein. These signals are recognized by transport machinery that directs the protein to the correct organelle, such as the nucleus, mitochondria, or ER.
99. **Molecular Basis of Membrane Transport:** Membrane transport is mediated by proteins. Channel proteins form hydrophilic pores through the membrane, allowing specific ions to pass through via facilitated diffusion. Carrier proteins bind to a specific solute and undergo a conformational change to transport it across the membrane. This can be passive (facilitated diffusion) or active (pumps).
100. **Integration of Cellular Processes:** A cell maintains homeostasis through the complex and highly regulated integration of its various processes. For example, the energy (ATP) produced by mitochondria during cellular respiration powers processes throughout the cell, including protein synthesis on ribosomes, transport across the membrane, and the maintenance of the cytoskeleton. This intricate network of interactions ensures the cell functions as a coordinated, living unit.
