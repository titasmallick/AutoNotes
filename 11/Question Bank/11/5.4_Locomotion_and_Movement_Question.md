22. **What is sarcomere? Explain its components.**
    A sarcomere is the functional unit of a myofibril. It consists of overlapping actin (thin) and myosin (thick) filaments, bounded by Z-lines. It includes A-bands, I-bands, and an H-zone.

23. **Differentiate between actin and myosin filaments.**
    -   **Actin (Thin Filament):** Composed of actin, troponin, and tropomyosin proteins. Forms the I-band.
    -   **Myosin (Thick Filament):** Composed of myosin protein with a head and a tail. Forms the A-band.

24. **Explain the banding pattern of sarcomere.**
    The sarcomere has a distinct banding pattern: the dark A-band (myosin and actin overlap), the light I-band (actin only), the H-zone in the center of the A-band (myosin only), and the M-line in the middle of the H-zone.

25. **What is the role of calcium in muscle contraction?**
    Calcium ions (Ca²⁺) bind to troponin on the actin filaments. This causes a conformational change that exposes the myosin-binding sites on actin, allowing cross-bridges to form.

26. **Describe the neuromuscular junction.**
    The neuromuscular junction is the synapse between a motor neuron and a skeletal muscle fiber. It is where the nerve impulse is transmitted to the muscle, initiating contraction.

27. **Explain the role of acetylcholine in muscle contraction.**
    Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter released at the neuromuscular junction. It binds to receptors on the sarcolemma, generating an action potential that triggers muscle contraction.

28. **What happens during the power stroke?**
    During the power stroke, the myosin head, bound to actin, pivots and pulls the actin filament toward the center of the sarcomere (M-line). This movement is powered by the hydrolysis of ATP.

29. **Describe muscle relaxation process.**
    Muscle relaxation occurs when the neural signal stops. Calcium ions are pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, troponin returns to its original shape, tropomyosin covers the actin binding sites, and the muscle fiber lengthens.

30. **What is cross-bridge cycle?**
    The cross-bridge cycle is the repeated sequence of events where myosin heads bind to actin, perform a power stroke, detach, and then re-cock for the next cycle. This process continues as long as calcium and ATP are present.

31. **Explain the role of ATP in muscle contraction.**
    ATP has two main roles in muscle contraction: its hydrolysis provides the energy for the power stroke, and its binding to the myosin head causes the detachment of the cross-bridge from actin.

32. **What are the symptoms of myasthenia gravis?**
    Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that causes fatigue, weakening, and paralysis of skeletal muscles. It affects the neuromuscular junction.

33. **Describe tetany and its cause.**
    Tetany is a condition characterized by rapid, involuntary muscle spasms (wild contractions). It is caused by low levels of calcium (Ca²⁺) in the body fluid.

34. **What is arthritis? Mention its types.**
    Arthritis is the inflammation of one or more joints. Common types include osteoarthritis (degenerative) and rheumatoid arthritis (autoimmune).

35. **Explain osteoporosis and its causes.**
    Osteoporosis is an age-related disorder characterized by decreased bone mass and increased risk of fractures. It is commonly caused by decreased levels of estrogen, particularly in post-menopausal women.

36. **What is gout? Describe its symptoms.**
    Gout is a form of arthritis caused by the accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints. It leads to severe pain, redness, and swelling, often in the big toe.

37. **Compare true ribs, false ribs, and floating ribs.**
    -   **True Ribs (1-7):** Attach directly to the sternum via their own costal cartilage.
    -   **False Ribs (8-10):** Their costal cartilages are attached to the cartilage of the 7th rib, not directly to the sternum.
    -   **Floating Ribs (11-12):** Do not attach to the sternum at all.

38. **Describe the structure and function of sternum.**
    The sternum, or breastbone, is a flat bone located in the anterior midline of the chest. It consists of three parts: the manubrium, body, and xiphoid process. Its primary function is to protect the heart and lungs and to serve as an attachment point for the ribs and clavicles.

39. **What are the functions of skeletal system?**
    The skeletal system provides structural support, protects vital organs, allows for movement through muscle attachment, stores minerals (like calcium), and is the site of blood cell formation (hematopoiesis).

40. **Explain the difference between bone and cartilage.**
    -   **Bone:** A hard, rigid connective tissue with a calcified matrix. It is highly vascular and provides the main structural framework of the body.
    -   **Cartilage:** A flexible, avascular connective tissue with a rubbery matrix. It provides support and cushioning in joints and other areas.

41. **What is the significance of synovial fluid?**
    Synovial fluid is a viscous fluid found in synovial joints. Its significance lies in lubricating the joint to reduce friction between the articular cartilages, absorbing shocks, and nourishing the cartilage cells.

42. **Describe the structure of synovial joint.**
    A synovial joint is characterized by a synovial cavity filled with fluid. It is enclosed by a fibrous joint capsule lined with a synovial membrane. The ends of the articulating bones are covered with smooth articular cartilage to reduce friction.

43. **What are the types of movements possible at joints?**
    Joints allow for various types of movements, including gliding (sliding), angular movements (flexion, extension, abduction, adduction), and rotational movements (rotation, circumduction).

44. **Explain flexion and extension movements.**
    -   **Flexion:** A movement that decreases the angle between two body parts. Example: Bending the elbow.
    -   **Extension:** A movement that increases the angle between two body parts, straightening it. Example: Straightening the knee.

45. **What is abduction and adduction?**
    -   **Abduction:** Movement of a limb away from the midline of the body. Example: Lifting the arm out to the side.
    -   **Adduction:** Movement of a limb toward the midline of the body. Example: Bringing the arm back to the side.

46. **Describe rotation and circumduction movements.**
    -   **Rotation:** Movement of a bone around its own long axis. Example: Turning the head from side to side.
    -   **Circumduction:** A circular movement of a limb, creating a cone shape. It is a combination of flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction. Example: Circling the arm.

47. **What is the function of ligaments?**
    Ligaments are strong, fibrous bands of connective tissue that connect bone to bone. Their primary function is to stabilize and support joints, preventing excessive or abnormal movements.

48. **Explain the role of tendons.**
    Tendons are tough, flexible bands of fibrous connective tissue that connect muscle to bone. Their role is to transmit the force generated by muscle contraction to the bone, thereby producing movement.

49. **What are the characteristics of skeletal muscles?**
    Skeletal muscles are striated (have a striped appearance), under voluntary control, and are typically attached to bones. They are responsible for locomotion and all voluntary movements of the body.

50. **Describe the properties of smooth muscles.**
    Smooth muscles are non-striated, involuntary muscles found in the walls of internal organs like the stomach, intestines, and blood vessels. They are responsible for processes like peristalsis and regulating blood pressure.

51. **What are the features of cardiac muscles?**
    Cardiac muscles are found only in the heart. They are striated, like skeletal muscles, but are involuntary. They have intercalated discs that connect the cells, allowing for synchronized contraction of the heart.

52. **Explain voluntary and involuntary muscles.**
    -   **Voluntary Muscles:** Muscles that are under conscious control. Skeletal muscles are the primary example.
    -   **Involuntary Muscles:** Muscles that are not under conscious control. Smooth and cardiac muscles are examples.

53. **What is the difference between striated and non-striated muscles?**
    -   **Striated Muscles:** Have a striped or banded appearance under a microscope due to the regular arrangement of sarcomeres (e.g., skeletal and cardiac muscle).
    -   **Non-striated Muscles:** Lack this banded appearance because their contractile proteins are not arranged in sarcomeres (e.g., smooth muscle).

54. **Describe the microscopic structure of skeletal muscle.**
    A skeletal muscle is composed of bundles of muscle fibers called fascicles. Each muscle fiber is a single, long, multinucleated cell containing myofibrils, which are made of repeating contractile units called sarcomeres.

55. **What is the role of sarcoplasmic reticulum?**
    The sarcoplasmic reticulum is a specialized type of smooth endoplasmic reticulum found in muscle cells. Its primary role is to store and release calcium ions (Ca²⁺), which are essential for initiating muscle contraction.

56. **Explain the function of T-tubules.**
    T-tubules (transverse tubules) are invaginations of the sarcolemma that penetrate deep into the muscle cell. Their function is to conduct the action potential from the cell surface to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, ensuring a rapid and coordinated release of calcium throughout the muscle fiber.
	
57. **What is excitation-contraction coupling?**
    Excitation-contraction coupling is the process by which a neural stimulus (excitation) triggers a muscle contraction. It involves the action potential traveling down the T-tubules, leading to calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the subsequent interaction of actin and myosin.

58. **Describe the sliding filament mechanism.**
    The sliding filament mechanism is the process of muscle contraction where the thin (actin) filaments slide past the thick (myosin) filaments. This sliding action pulls the Z-lines closer together, shortening the sarcomere and thus the entire muscle.

59. **What happens during muscle fatigue?**
    Muscle fatigue is the decline in the ability of a muscle to generate force. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including the accumulation of lactic acid, depletion of ATP and glycogen stores, and ionic imbalances.

60. **Explain oxygen debt in muscles.**
    Oxygen debt (now more commonly referred to as EPOC - Excess Post-exercise Oxygen Consumption) is the extra oxygen the body needs after strenuous exercise to restore metabolic conditions to the resting level. This includes converting lactic acid back to glucose and replenishing ATP and creatine phosphate stores.

61. **What is the all-or-none law of muscle contraction?**
    The all-or-none law states that an individual muscle fiber will contract to its fullest extent or not at all in response to a stimulus. If the stimulus is strong enough to reach the threshold, the fiber will contract completely.

62. **Describe isotonic and isometric contractions.**
    -   **Isotonic Contraction:** The muscle changes length while the tension remains constant. Example: Lifting a weight.
    -   **Isometric Contraction:** The muscle develops tension but does not change in length. Example: Pushing against an immovable wall.

63. **What is muscle tone?**
    Muscle tone is the continuous and passive partial contraction of the muscles, or the muscle's resistance to passive stretch during the resting state. It helps maintain posture and keeps muscles ready for action.

64. **Explain motor unit.**
    A motor unit consists of a single motor neuron and all the muscle fibers it innervates. The size of a motor unit varies; fine control muscles (like in the eye) have small motor units, while large weight-bearing muscles (like the quadriceps) have large motor units.

65. **What is the role of motor neuron in muscle contraction?**
    A motor neuron transmits the nerve impulse from the central nervous system to the muscle fibers. The release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine from the motor neuron at the neuromuscular junction initiates the action potential that leads to muscle contraction.

66. **Describe the graded response in muscles.**
    A graded response refers to the ability of a whole muscle to contract with varying degrees of force. This is achieved by changing the frequency of stimulation of muscle fibers and by recruiting a varying number of motor units.

67. **What is summation in muscle contraction?**
    Summation is the process where the force of a second muscle contraction is added to the first if it occurs before the muscle has fully relaxed. This results in a stronger, more sustained contraction.

68. **Explain tetanus in muscle physiology.**
    Tetanus (or tetanic contraction) is a sustained muscle contraction that occurs when the frequency of stimulation is so high that the muscle has no time to relax between stimuli. This results in a smooth, continuous contraction, which is how most voluntary movements are produced.

69. **What are fast and slow twitch muscle fibers?**
    -   **Slow-twitch (Type I):** Contract slowly, are resistant to fatigue, and are rich in myoglobin and mitochondria. They are used for endurance activities like long-distance running.
    -   **Fast-twitch (Type II):** Contract quickly and powerfully but fatigue rapidly. They are used for short, explosive movements like sprinting.

70. **Describe the energy sources for muscle contraction.**
    The immediate source of energy for muscle contraction is ATP. Muscles have a small store of ATP, which is quickly replenished by three main systems: the creatine phosphate system (for short bursts), anaerobic glycolysis (for intermediate activity), and aerobic respiration (for sustained activity).

71. **What is creatine phosphate system?**
    The creatine phosphate system is a rapid way to generate ATP. Creatine phosphate stored in the muscle donates a phosphate group to ADP to form ATP. This provides energy for the first few seconds of intense muscular activity.

72. **Explain anaerobic glycolysis in muscles.**
    Anaerobic glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose to pyruvic acid (and then to lactic acid) without the use of oxygen. It provides a rapid supply of ATP for short-term, high-intensity exercise when oxygen delivery is insufficient.

73. **What is the role of myoglobin in muscles?**
    Myoglobin is an oxygen-storing protein found in muscle cells, particularly abundant in slow-twitch fibers. It acts as a local oxygen reserve, releasing oxygen when the demand is high, thus facilitating aerobic respiration.

74. **Describe muscle hypertrophy and atrophy.**
    -   **Hypertrophy:** An increase in the size of muscle fibers, and thus the muscle as a whole, typically in response to resistance training.
    -   **Atrophy:** A decrease in the size of muscle fibers, and thus the muscle as a whole, due to disuse, denervation, or disease.

75. **What are the effects of exercise on muscles?**
    Regular exercise leads to several adaptations in muscles. Aerobic exercise improves endurance by increasing mitochondria and blood supply. Resistance exercise leads to hypertrophy, increasing muscle strength and size.

76. **Explain the importance of warm-up before exercise.**
    Warming up before exercise increases muscle temperature and blood flow. This improves muscle elasticity, enhances the speed of nerve impulses, and increases the rate of energy production, which helps to improve performance and reduce the risk of injury.

77. **What causes muscle cramps?**
    Muscle cramps are sudden, involuntary, and painful contractions of a muscle. They can be caused by dehydration, electrolyte imbalances (e.g., low potassium or calcium), muscle fatigue, or nerve irritation.

78. **Describe the healing process of bone fractures.**
    Bone healing is a multi-stage process. First, a hematoma (blood clot) forms at the fracture site. This is followed by the formation of a fibrocartilaginous callus, which is then converted into a bony callus. Finally, the bony callus is remodeled into mature bone tissue.

79. **What is the role of calcium and phosphorus in bones?**
    Calcium and phosphorus are the primary minerals that make up the inorganic matrix of bone, forming hydroxyapatite crystals. These minerals give bones their hardness and rigidity, making them strong and supportive.

80. **Explain the importance of vitamin D for bones.**
    Vitamin D is essential for bone health because it facilitates the absorption of calcium from the small intestine into the bloodstream. Without sufficient vitamin D, the body cannot effectively absorb calcium, which can lead to weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis or rickets).

81. **What are the effects of aging on skeletal system?**
    With aging, bone density tends to decrease (osteoporosis), making bones more brittle and susceptible to fractures. Cartilage in joints can wear down, leading to osteoarthritis, and ligaments may become less elastic, reducing flexibility.

82. **Describe the gender differences in skeletal system.**
    The male skeleton is generally larger and heavier than the female skeleton. The female pelvis is typically wider and shallower than the male pelvis to facilitate childbirth. These differences are primarily influenced by sex hormones.

83. **What is the role of hormones in bone development?**
    Several hormones regulate bone development. Growth hormone stimulates bone growth during childhood. Thyroid hormones promote bone formation. Sex hormones (estrogen and testosterone) are crucial for bone growth during puberty and for maintaining bone mass in adults.

84. **Explain the process of ossification.**
    Ossification is the process of bone formation. There are two types: intramembranous ossification (where bone develops from a fibrous membrane, e.g., flat bones of the skull) and endochondral ossification (where bone replaces a hyaline cartilage model, e.g., long bones).

85. **What are growth plates in bones?**
    Growth plates, or epiphyseal plates, are areas of hyaline cartilage located at the ends of long bones in children and adolescents. They are the sites where longitudinal bone growth occurs. They close (ossify) at the end of puberty.

86. **Describe the blood supply to bones.**
    Bones are highly vascular tissues. They receive blood from nutrient arteries that enter the bone shaft, as well as from periosteal and epiphyseal arteries. This blood supply is essential for delivering nutrients, oxygen, and hormones, and for removing waste products.

87. **What is the lymphatic drainage of bones?**
    Bones have a network of lymphatic vessels, primarily located in the periosteum. These vessels are important for draining interstitial fluid, immune surveillance, and are also implicated in the process of bone remodeling and repair.

88. **Explain the innervation of skeletal muscles.**
    Skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons, which transmit signals from the central nervous system to cause contraction. They also contain sensory neurons that provide feedback to the CNS about muscle length and tension (proprioception).

89. **What are the postural muscles?**
    Postural muscles are muscles that are responsible for maintaining the body's posture against gravity. They are typically dominated by slow-twitch muscle fibers and are in a constant state of low-level contraction (muscle tone). Examples include the muscles of the back and neck.

90. **Describe the muscles of facial expression.**
    The muscles of facial expression are a group of skeletal muscles that insert into the skin of the face. Their contraction produces various facial expressions, such as smiling, frowning, and raising the eyebrows. They are innervated by the facial nerve.

91. **What are the muscles of mastication?**
    The muscles of mastication are the four muscles responsible for chewing. They are the temporalis, masseter, and medial and lateral pterygoids. They act on the mandible (lower jaw) to produce movements like elevation, depression, protraction, and retraction.

92. **Explain the respiratory muscles.**
    The primary respiratory muscles are the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles. The diaphragm is a large, dome-shaped muscle that contracts to increase the volume of the thoracic cavity during inhalation. The intercostal muscles, located between the ribs, also assist in changing the volume of the chest cavity.

93. **What are the core muscles?**
    The core muscles are the group of muscles in the trunk that stabilize the spine and pelvis. They include the abdominal muscles, muscles of the lower back, and the pelvic floor muscles. A strong core is essential for stability, balance, and posture.

94. **Describe the limb muscles.**
    Limb muscles are the muscles of the arms and legs. They are responsible for all movements of the limbs, such as walking, running, lifting, and grasping. They are organized into compartments that produce specific movements (e.g., flexors and extensors).

95. **What is the role of proprioception in movement?**
    Proprioception is the body's ability to sense its own position, motion, and equilibrium. Sensory receptors in muscles, tendons, and joints provide the central nervous system with continuous feedback, which is crucial for coordinated and accurate movement.

96. **Explain balance and coordination.**
    Balance is the ability to maintain the body's center of gravity over its base of support. Coordination is the ability to use different parts of the body together smoothly and efficiently. Both are complex processes involving the cerebellum, inner ear, and proprioceptive feedback.

97. **What are reflexes in relation to movement?**
    Reflexes are rapid, involuntary responses to a stimulus. In movement, they serve protective functions (e.g., the withdrawal reflex from a painful stimulus) and are also involved in maintaining posture and coordinating basic movement patterns like walking.

98. **Describe the role of cerebellum in movement.**
    The cerebellum plays a critical role in motor control. It does not initiate movement but contributes to its coordination, precision, and accurate timing. It receives sensory input and integrates it to fine-tune motor activity, and is also important for motor learning.

99. **What is the motor cortex?**
    The motor cortex is the region of the cerebral cortex involved in the planning, control, and execution of voluntary movements. The primary motor cortex is responsible for generating the neural impulses that control the execution of movement.

100. **Explain the spinal control of movement.**
     The spinal cord acts as more than just a relay station; it contains complex neural circuits called central pattern generators (CPGs) that can generate the rhythmic patterns of motor output needed for movements like walking, without direct input from the brain for each step. It also mediates various reflexes.

11. **Describe the role of calcium ions in muscle contraction and relaxation processes.**
    *   **Contraction:** Ca²⁺ released from sarcoplasmic reticulum. Binds to troponin on actin filaments, causing tropomyosin to move and expose myosin-binding sites on actin. This allows cross-bridge formation.
    *   **Relaxation:** When neural signal stops, Ca²⁺ is actively pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This removes Ca²⁺ from troponin, allowing tropomyosin to cover the myosin-binding sites on actin, preventing cross-bridge formation and leading to muscle relaxation.

12. **Explain the events at the neuromuscular junction during muscle stimulation.**
    *   A neural signal (action potential) arrives at the axon terminal of a motor neuron.
    *   This causes the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft.

    *   This binding generates an action potential in the sarcolemma, initiating muscle contraction.

13. **Give a detailed account of the cross-bridge cycle in muscle contraction.**
    *   **Cross-Bridge Formation:** Myosin heads, energized by ATP hydrolysis, bind to exposed active sites on actin filaments (after Ca²⁺ binds to troponin).

    *   **Cross-Bridge Detachment:** A new ATP molecule binds to the myosin head, causing it to detach from the actin filament.
    *   **Myosin Head Re-cocking:** The newly bound ATP is hydrolyzed into ADP and Pi, re-energizing and re-cocking the myosin head, preparing it for another cycle. This cycle continues as long as Ca²⁺ and ATP are available.

14. **Describe the energy requirements and ATP utilization during muscle contraction and relaxation.**
    *   **Contraction:** ATP is hydrolyzed during the power stroke (myosin pulling actin) to provide energy for the movement.
