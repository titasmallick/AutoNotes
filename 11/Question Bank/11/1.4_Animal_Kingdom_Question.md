## SECTION C: TWO MARK QUESTIONS

1. **Cellular vs. Tissue Level:** In cellular level organization (e.g., Sponges), cells are loose aggregates and do not form tissues. In tissue level organization (e.g., Coelenterates), cells with similar function are organized into tissues.
2. **Symmetry:** Radial symmetry (e.g., Hydra) means the body can be divided into identical halves by any plane passing through the central axis. Bilateral symmetry (e.g., Humans) means the body can be divided into identical left and right halves by only one plane.
3. **Diploblastic vs. Triploblastic:** Diploblastic animals (e.g., Coelenterates) have two germ layers, ectoderm and endoderm. Triploblastic animals (e.g., Flatworms to Chordates) have a third germ layer, mesoderm, between the ectoderm and endoderm.
4. **Acoelomate vs. Coelomate:** Acoelomate animals (e.g., Flatworms) lack a body cavity. Coelomate animals (e.g., Annelids) have a true coelom, a body cavity lined by mesoderm.
5. **Water Transport in Sponges:** Water enters through pores (ostia) into a central cavity (spongocoel) and exits through the osculum. This system aids in food gathering, respiration, and waste removal.
6. **Body Forms in Coelenterates:** The polyp is a sessile, cylindrical form (e.g., *Hydra*). The medusa is a free-swimming, umbrella-shaped form (e.g., *Aurelia*).
7. **Alternation of Generation:** This is a phenomenon where one generation reproduces asexually, and the next reproduces sexually. It is seen in some Coelenterates like *Obelia*.
8. **Flame Cells:** These are specialized cells in flatworms that help in osmoregulation (water balance) and excretion of waste products.
9. **Digestive System in Roundworms:** Roundworms have a complete digestive system with a mouth, a muscular pharynx for sucking in food, an intestine, and an anus.
10. **Metamerism:** This is the serial repetition of similar body segments. It is characteristic of Annelids (e.g., Earthworm).
11. **Closed Circulatory System in Annelids:** Blood is confined to vessels and circulates throughout the body, allowing for efficient transport of oxygen and nutrients.
12. **Open Circulatory System in Arthropods:** Blood (hemolymph) is pumped by the heart into the body cavity (hemocoel), where it bathes the tissues directly.
13. **Jointed Appendages in Arthropods:** These allow for a wide range of movements, including walking, swimming, feeding, and sensory perception, contributing to their success.
14. **Mantle and Mantle Cavity in Molluscs:** The mantle is a soft layer of skin that covers the visceral hump and secretes the shell. The mantle cavity is the space between the mantle and the hump, containing gills for respiration.
15. **Water Vascular System in Echinoderms:** This is a system of canals filled with water, which helps in locomotion (through tube feet), food capture and transport, and respiration.
16. **Chordate Features:** The three fundamental features are a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, and paired pharyngeal gill slits.
17. **Notochord vs. Vertebral Column:** The notochord is a flexible rod-like structure found in all chordates at some stage of life. In vertebrates, it is replaced by a bony or cartilaginous vertebral column in the adult.
18. **Urochordata vs. Cephalochordata:** In Urochordata, the notochord is present only in the larval tail. In Cephalochordata, the notochord extends from head to tail and persists throughout life.
19. **Parasitic Lifestyle of Cyclostomata:** They have a sucking and circular mouth without jaws, which they use to attach to other fishes and suck their blood.
20. **Cartilaginous vs. Bony Fishes:** Cartilaginous fishes have a skeleton made of cartilage, placoid scales, and lack an operculum. Bony fishes have a bony skeleton, cycloid/ctenoid scales, and an operculum covering the gills.
21. **Amphibian Adaptations:** They can live on both land and in water. They have moist skin for respiration, and also possess lungs. They have a three-chambered heart.
22. **Reptilian Skin:** The skin is dry and cornified, covered with epidermal scales or scutes, which prevents water loss and provides protection.
23. **Flight Adaptations in Birds:** They have feathers, forelimbs modified into wings, pneumatic (hollow) bones to reduce weight, and a streamlined body.
24. **Uniqueness of Mammals:** The most unique feature is the presence of mammary glands for nourishing their young. They also have hair on their skin and external ears (pinnae).
25. **Economic Importance of Arthropods:** Some are beneficial, like honey bees (*Apis*) for honey and pollination, and silkworms (*Bombyx*) for silk. Others are harmful, like mosquitoes which are vectors for diseases.
26. **Pearl Formation in Molluscs:** When a foreign particle enters the mantle, the mantle secretes layers of nacre around it, which eventually forms a pearl. This is seen in pearl oysters (*Pinctada*).
27. **Significance of Bilateral Symmetry:** It allows for cephalization (development of a head) and streamlined movement, which is advantageous for active animals.
28. **Cephalization:** This is the concentration of sense organs, nervous control, etc., at the anterior end of the body, forming a head and brain. It is associated with bilateral symmetry.

67. **Viviparity in Mammals:** Most mammals are viviparous, meaning they give birth to live young. The developing embryo is nourished inside the mother's body.
68. **Oviparity in Birds:** Birds are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs. The embryo develops inside the egg, which is incubated by the parents.
69. **Significance of External Fertilization:** This type of fertilization occurs outside the body, usually in water. It is common in aquatic animals like fishes and amphibians.
70. **Internal Fertilization in Terrestrial Animals:** This type of fertilization occurs inside the female's body. It is an adaptation to terrestrial life, as it prevents the gametes from drying out.
71. **Larval Stage in Amphibians:** Amphibians have a larval stage (tadpole) that is aquatic and breathes through gills. It undergoes metamorphosis to become a terrestrial adult.
72. **Significance of Metamorphosis:** This is a process of transformation from an immature form to an adult form in two or more distinct stages. It allows the larva and adult to occupy different ecological niches, reducing competition.
73. **Direct Development in Reptiles:** Reptiles undergo direct development, meaning the young hatch from the egg as miniature versions of the adult. There is no larval stage.

77. **Colonial Organization in Coelenterates:** Some coelenterates, like corals, live in colonies of interconnected polyps.
78. **Significance of Polymorphism:** This is the occurrence of different body forms within the same species. In coelenterates, it allows for a division of labor between polyps (for feeding) and medusae (for reproduction).
79. **Parasite-Host Relationship:** A parasite is an organism that lives in or on another organism (the host) and benefits by deriving nutrients at the host's expense.
80. **Symbiotic Relationships:** This is a close and long-term interaction between two different biological species. It can be mutualistic (both benefit), commensalistic (one benefits, the other is unaffected), or parasitic (one benefits, the other is harmed).

90. **Explain the role of animals in biotechnology.**
    - **Transgenic Animals:** Animals that have had a foreign gene deliberately inserted into their genome. They can be used to produce pharmaceuticals (e.g., goats that produce a drug in their milk) or to study diseases.
    - **Cloning:** Producing a genetically identical copy of an animal.
    - **Source of Biomolecules:** Animals are a source of useful molecules like enzymes and antibodies.
91. **Describe the animal models in medical research and drug development.**
    - **Animal Model:** An animal with a disease or condition that is similar to a human disease.
    - **Use:** They are used to study the mechanisms of the disease and to test potential treatments. For example, mice are often used as models for cancer and genetic disorders.
92. **Explain the biomimetics and lessons learned from animal adaptations.**
    - **Biomimetics (or Biomimicry):** The design and production of materials, structures, and systems that are modeled on biological entities and processes.
    - **Examples:**
        - Velcro, inspired by the burrs that stick to animal fur.
        - The design of aircraft wings, inspired by the shape of bird wings.
        - The development of new adhesives based on the gecko's ability to climb walls.
93. **Describe the role of animals in agriculture and pest control.**
    - **Agriculture:** Domesticated animals are essential for producing meat, milk, eggs, and wool. They are also used for labor (plowing fields).
    - **Pest Control:** Some animals are natural predators of agricultural pests. For example, birds and bats can help to control insect populations.
94. **Explain the marine fisheries and their sustainable management.**
