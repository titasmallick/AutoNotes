Disaccharides are formed from two monosaccharides, such as sucrose (glucose + fructose). Polysaccharides are long chains of monosaccharides, like starch and cellulose.
2.  **Describe the structure of monosaccharides.**
    Monosaccharides are the simplest form of carbohydrates. They are polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones with a general formula of (CH₂O)n. They contain a carbon chain of 3-7 carbons, with a carbonyl group (aldehyde or ketone) and multiple hydroxyl groups.
3.  **Compare and contrast sucrose, lactose, and maltose.**
    All three are disaccharides. Sucrose is composed of glucose and fructose, lactose of glucose and galactose, and maltose of two glucose units. Sucrose is non-reducing, while lactose and maltose are reducing sugars.
4.  **Explain the difference between starch and cellulose.**
    Both are polysaccharides of glucose. Starch is the storage form of glucose in plants and has alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 glycosidic bonds. Cellulose is a structural component of plant cell walls and has beta-1,4 glycosidic bonds, making it indigestible for most animals.
5.  **Describe the functions of different polysaccharides.**
    Starch and glycogen serve as energy storage in plants and animals, respectively. Cellulose provides structural support to plant cell walls. Chitin provides structural support to fungal cell walls and arthropod exoskeletons.
6.  **Explain the basic structure of amino acids.**
    An amino acid has a central carbon atom (the alpha-carbon) bonded to an amino group (-NH₂), a carboxyl group (-COOH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and a variable side chain (R group).
7.  **Describe the classification of amino acids based on R groups.**
    Amino acids are classified based on the properties of their R group. They can be nonpolar (hydrophobic), polar (hydrophilic), acidic (negatively charged), or basic (positively charged).
8.  **Explain how peptide bonds are formed.**
    A peptide bond is a covalent bond formed between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another, with the removal of a water molecule (dehydration synthesis).
9.  **Describe the primary and secondary structures of proteins.**
    The primary structure is the linear sequence of amino acids. The secondary structure refers to the local folding of the polypeptide chain into structures like the α-helix and β-pleated sheet, stabilized by hydrogen bonds.
10. **Explain the tertiary and quaternary structures of proteins.**
    The tertiary structure is the overall 3D shape of a single polypeptide chain, stabilized by various bonds. The quaternary structure is the arrangement of multiple polypeptide chains (subunits) to form a functional protein.
11. **Describe the general properties of lipids.**
    Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic molecules, meaning they are insoluble in water. They are soluble in nonpolar organic solvents and include fats, oils, waxes, and steroids.
12. **Compare fats and oils in terms of structure and function.**
    Fats and oils are both triglycerides, composed of glycerol and fatty acids. Fats are solid at room temperature and have saturated fatty acids, while oils are liquid and have unsaturated fatty acids. Both are used for energy storage.
13. **Explain the structure and function of phospholipids.**
    Phospholipids have a hydrophilic (water-loving) head and a hydrophobic (water-fearing) tail. They are the main component of cell membranes, forming a bilayer that separates the cell from its environment.
14. **Describe the characteristic features of steroids.**
    Steroids are lipids characterized by a four-ring carbon structure. Examples include cholesterol, which is a component of cell membranes, and steroid hormones like testosterone and estrogen.
15. **Explain the general properties of enzymes.**
    Enzymes are biological catalysts, typically proteins, that speed up biochemical reactions. They are highly specific for their substrates and work under optimal conditions of temperature and pH.
16. **Describe the mechanism of enzyme action.**
    Enzymes lower the activation energy of a reaction by binding to the substrate at the active site, forming an enzyme-substrate complex. This facilitates the conversion of the substrate into the product.
17. **Explain the factors affecting enzyme activity.**
    Enzyme activity is affected by temperature, pH, substrate concentration, and the presence of inhibitors. Each enzyme has an optimal temperature and pH at which it functions most effectively.
18. **Describe the classification of enzymes with examples.**
    Enzymes are classified into six major classes: Oxidoreductases (e.g., alcohol dehydrogenase), Transferases (e.g., hexokinase), Hydrolases (e.g., sucrase), Lyases (e.g., aldolase), Isomerases (e.g., triosephosphate isomerase), and Ligases (e.g., DNA ligase).
19. **Explain the role of cofactors in enzyme function.**
    Cofactors are non-protein molecules that are required by some enzymes to be active. They can be metal ions (e.g., Zn²⁺, Mg²⁺) or organic molecules called coenzymes (e.g., NAD⁺, FAD).
20. **Define secondary metabolites and give examples.**
    Secondary metabolites are organic compounds produced by organisms that are not directly involved in their growth, development, or reproduction. Examples include alkaloids (morphine), terpenoids (menthol), and phenolics (tannins).

24. **Explain the importance of protein folding.**
    Proper protein folding is crucial for its function. Misfolded proteins can be inactive or toxic, leading to diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
25. **Describe the amphiphilic nature of phospholipids.**
    Phospholipids are amphiphilic because they have a hydrophilic (polar) head and a hydrophobic (nonpolar) tail, allowing them to form cell membranes in aqueous environments.
26. **Explain the biological significance of cholesterol.**
    Cholesterol is a vital component of animal cell membranes, regulating membrane fluidity. It is also a precursor for steroid hormones, vitamin D, and bile acids.
27. **Describe the specificity of enzymes.**
    Enzyme specificity refers to the ability of an enzyme to catalyze only one or a few specific reactions, due to the unique shape of its active site that complements the substrate.
28. **Explain the concept of activation energy in enzyme catalysis.**
    Activation energy is the energy required to start a chemical reaction. Enzymes increase the rate of reaction by lowering the activation energy barrier.
29. **Describe the different types of enzyme inhibition.**
    *   **Competitive inhibition:** An inhibitor competes with the substrate for the active site.
    *   **Non-competitive inhibition:** An inhibitor binds to a site other than the active site, altering the enzyme's shape.
30. **Explain the importance of secondary metabolites in plants.**
    Secondary metabolites in plants have various functions, including defense against herbivores and pathogens, attracting pollinators, and protection from UV radiation.
31. **Compare monosaccharides and disaccharides.**
    Monosaccharides are single sugar units (e.g., glucose), while disaccharides are composed of two monosaccharide units (e.g., sucrose). Monosaccharides are the basic building blocks of carbohydrates.
32. **Describe the hydrolysis of disaccharides.**
    Hydrolysis is the breakdown of a disaccharide into its constituent monosaccharides by the addition of a water molecule, a reaction often catalyzed by enzymes.
33. **Explain the structural differences between starch and glycogen.**
    Both are polymers of glucose, but glycogen is more highly branched than starch, allowing for more rapid release of glucose when needed.
34. **Describe the cell wall composition in plants.**
    The plant cell wall is primarily composed of cellulose, a polysaccharide that provides structural support and protection to the cell.
35. **Explain the role of proteins in living organisms.**
    Proteins have a vast range of functions, including acting as enzymes, providing structural support (e.g., collagen), transporting molecules (e.g., hemoglobin), and serving as hormones.
36. **Describe the process of protein synthesis.**
    Protein synthesis involves two main stages: transcription (copying a gene's DNA sequence into mRNA) and translation (decoding the mRNA sequence to assemble a chain of amino acids).
37. **Explain the denaturation and renaturation of proteins.**
    Denaturation is the loss of a protein's native structure and function due to factors like heat or pH changes. Renaturation is the process where a denatured protein refolds into its original structure, which is not always possible.
38. **Describe the classification of lipids.**
    Lipids are broadly classified into simple lipids (e.g., fats, oils, waxes), compound lipids (e.g., phospholipids, glycolipids), and derived lipids (e.g., steroids, fatty acids).
39. **Explain the energy storage function of lipids.**
    Lipids, particularly triglycerides, are a major long-term energy storage form in animals, providing more than twice the energy per gram compared to carbohydrates.
40. **Describe the structure of cell membranes.**
    The cell membrane is a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins, cholesterol, and carbohydrates, creating a fluid mosaic structure that is selectively permeable.

42. **Describe the naming convention for enzymes.**
    Enzymes are typically named by adding the suffix "-ase" to the name of their substrate (e.g., lactase breaks down lactose) or the type of reaction they catalyze (e.g., polymerase).
43. **Explain the induced fit model of enzyme action.**
    The induced fit model suggests that the active site of an enzyme is flexible and changes its shape to fit the substrate more snugly upon binding.
44. **Describe the optimum conditions for enzyme activity.**
    Every enzyme has an optimal temperature and pH at which its catalytic activity is highest. Deviations from these optima can lead to a decrease in activity or denaturation.
45. **Explain the concept of enzyme-substrate complex.**
