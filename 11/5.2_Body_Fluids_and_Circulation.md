# Chapter 5.2: Body Fluids and Circulation

## 1. Blood
- **Definition:** A special connective tissue consisting of a fluid matrix, plasma, and formed elements.
- **Plasma:**
    - Straw-colored, viscous fluid constituting nearly 55% of the blood.
    - Contains 90-92% water and 6-8% proteins (fibrinogen, globulins, albumins).
    - Also contains minerals (Na⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, HCO₃⁻, Cl⁻), glucose, amino acids, lipids, etc.
    - **Serum:** Plasma without clotting factors.
- **Formed Elements:** Constitute nearly 45% of the blood.
    - **Erythrocytes (Red Blood Cells - RBCs):**
        - Most abundant of all cells in blood.
        - Biconcave, anucleated (in mammals).
        - Contain haemoglobin, a red-colored, iron-containing complex protein.
        - Formed in the red bone marrow in adults.
        - Life span of about 120 days.
    - **Leucocytes (White Blood Cells - WBCs):**
        - Nucleated and relatively less in number.
        - Generally short-lived.
        - **Granulocytes:** Neutrophils, Eosinophils, Basophils.
        - **Agranulocytes:** Lymphocytes, Monocytes.
        - **Neutrophils:** Most abundant WBCs, phagocytic.
        - **Eosinophils:** Associated with allergic reactions and parasitic infections.
        - **Basophils:** Secrete histamine, serotonin, heparin; involved in inflammatory reactions.
        - **Monocytes:** Phagocytic.
        - **Lymphocytes:** B and T lymphocytes, responsible for immune responses.
    - **Platelets (Thrombocytes):**
        - Cell fragments produced from megakaryocytes.
        - Involved in coagulation or clotting of blood.

## 2. Blood Groups
- **ABO Grouping:** Based on the presence or absence of two surface antigens on RBCs, A and B.
    - **Blood Group A:** Has antigen A, antibody anti-B.
    - **Blood Group B:** Has antigen B, antibody anti-A.
    - **Blood Group AB:** Has antigens A and B, no antibodies (universal recipient).
    - **Blood Group O:** Has no antigens, antibodies anti-A and anti-B (universal donor).
- **Rh Grouping:** Based on the presence or absence of Rh antigen.
    - **Rh positive (Rh⁺):** Has Rh antigen.
    - **Rh negative (Rh⁻):** Does not have Rh antigen.
    - **Erythroblastosis foetalis:** A severe anaemia and jaundice of the newborn, caused by Rh incompatibility between an Rh⁻ mother and an Rh⁺ fetus.

## 3. Coagulation of Blood (Blood Clotting)
- A mechanism to prevent excessive loss of blood from the body.
- **Process:**
    - Injury to blood vessels stimulates platelets to release certain factors.
    - These factors, along with calcium ions, activate a cascade of reactions.
    - Prothrombin (inactive) is converted to thrombin (active) by thrombokinase.
    - Thrombin converts soluble fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin threads.
    - Fibrin threads form a meshwork that traps formed elements, forming a clot.

## 4. Lymph (Tissue Fluid)
- **Definition:** A colorless fluid containing specialized lymphocytes, which are responsible for immune responses of the body.
- **Formation:** As blood passes through capillaries, some water and small soluble substances move out into the intercellular spaces, forming the tissue fluid or lymph.
- **Functions:**
    - Transports nutrients, O₂, etc., to the cells and CO₂, metabolic wastes, etc., away from the cells.
    - Involved in immunity.
    - Absorbs fatty acids and glycerol through lacteals in the intestine.

## 5. Heart Structure
- **Location:** Located in the thoracic cavity, between the two lungs, slightly tilted to the left.
- **Covering:** Protected by a double-walled membranous bag, the pericardium, enclosing the pericardial fluid.
- **Chambers:** Four chambers.
    - **Atria:** Two upper, smaller chambers (right and left atria).
    - **Ventricles:** Two lower, larger chambers (right and left ventricles).
- **Valves:**
    - **Tricuspid Valve:** Between the right atrium and right ventricle.
    - **Bicuspid (Mitral) Valve:** Between the left atrium and left ventricle.
    - **Semilunar Valves:** At the opening of the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery and the left ventricle into the aorta.

## 6. Cardiac Cycle
- **Definition:** The sequential event in the heart which is cyclically repeated. It consists of systole (contraction) and diastole (relaxation) of both the atria and ventricles.
- **Steps:**
    1. **Joint Diastole:** All four chambers are in a relaxed state. Blood flows from the atria to the ventricles.
    2. **Atrial Systole:** Atria contract, pushing the remaining blood into the ventricles.
    3. **Ventricular Systole:** Ventricles contract. This closes the AV valves (tricuspid and bicuspid) producing the first heart sound (lub). Semilunar valves open, and blood is pumped into the pulmonary artery and aorta.
    4. **Ventricular Diastole:** Ventricles relax. This closes the semilunar valves, producing the second heart sound (dub).
- **Duration:** Approximately 0.8 seconds.

## 7. Electrocardiograph (ECG)
- **Definition:** A graphical representation of the electrical activity of the heart during a cardiac cycle.
- **Waves:**
    - **P-wave:** Represents atrial depolarization (contraction).
    - **QRS complex:** Represents ventricular depolarization (contraction). The largest wave.
    - **T-wave:** Represents ventricular repolarization (relaxation).

## 8. Double Circulation
- **Definition:** The blood flows twice through the heart to complete one cycle.
- **Types:**
    - **Pulmonary Circulation:** Deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle is pumped into the pulmonary artery, goes to the lungs for oxygenation, and returns as oxygenated blood to the left atrium via pulmonary veins.
    - **Systemic Circulation:** Oxygenated blood from the left ventricle is pumped into the aorta, distributed to various body parts, and returns as deoxygenated blood to the right atrium via vena cava.

## 9. Blood Pressure
- **Definition:** The pressure exerted by the blood on the walls of the arteries.
- **Systolic Pressure:** The pressure during ventricular contraction (approx. 120 mmHg).
- **Diastolic Pressure:** The pressure during ventricular relaxation (approx. 80 mmHg).
- **Hypertension (High Blood Pressure):** Blood pressure higher than 140/90 mmHg.

## 10. Disorders of Circulatory System
- **Hypertension:** High blood pressure.
- **Coronary Artery Disease (CAD):** Affects the vessels that supply blood to the heart muscle. Caused by atherosclerosis (deposition of calcium, fat, cholesterol, and fibrous tissues).
- **Angina Pectoris:** Acute chest pain when no enough oxygen is reaching the heart muscle.
- **Heart Failure:** The state of heart when it is not pumping blood effectively enough to meet the needs of the body.
- **Cardiac Arrest:** The heart stops beating.
- **Heart Attack:** When the heart muscle is suddenly damaged by an inadequate blood supply.
