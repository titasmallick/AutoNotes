# Chapter 2.1: Morphology of Flowering Plants

## 1. The Root
- **Definition:** The non-green, underground, positively geotropic, and negatively phototropic part of the plant.
- **Types of Root Systems:**
    - **Tap Root System:** Consists of a main primary root and its branches (lateral roots). Found in dicotyledonous plants. e.g., Mustard, Gram.
    - **Fibrous Root System:** The primary root is short-lived and is replaced by a large number of roots originating from the base of the stem. Found in monocotyledonous plants. e.g., Wheat, Rice.
    - **Adventitious Root System:** Roots that arise from any part of the plant other than the radicle. e.g., Grass, *Monstera*, Banyan tree.
- **Modifications of Root:**
    - **For Storage:**
        - **Tap Roots:** Conical (Carrot), Fusiform (Radish), Napiform (Turnip).
        - **Adventitious Roots:** Tuberous (Sweet Potato).
    - **For Support:**
        - **Prop Roots:** Hanging roots that support the branches of a tree. e.g., Banyan tree.
        - **Stilt Roots:** Supporting roots coming out of the lower nodes of the stem. e.g., Maize, Sugarcane.
    - **For Respiration:**
        - **Pneumatophores:** Roots that grow vertically upwards from the soil to get oxygen for respiration. Found in plants growing in swampy areas. e.g., *Rhizophora*.

## 2. The Stem
- **Definition:** The ascending part of the axis bearing branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits.
- **Modifications of Stem:**
    - **For Storage:** Underground stems like Potato (tuber), Ginger (rhizome), Garlic (bulb), Colocasia (corm).
    - **For Support:** Stem tendrils which develop from axillary buds. e.g., Gourds (cucumber, pumpkins), Grapevines.
    - **For Protection:** Thorns, which are woody, straight, and pointed structures developing from axillary buds. e.g., *Citrus*, *Bougainvillea*.
    - **For Photosynthesis:** In some arid plants, stems are modified into flattened (*Opuntia*) or fleshy cylindrical (*Euphorbia*) structures containing chlorophyll.
    - **For Vegetative Propagation:** Underground stems (Potato, Ginger), runners/stolons (*Oxalis*, Strawberry), offsets (*Pistia*, *Eichhornia*).

## 3. The Leaf
- **Definition:** A lateral, generally flattened structure borne on the stem, responsible for photosynthesis.
- **Types of Leaves:**
    - **Simple Leaf:** The lamina is entire or when incised, the incisions do not touch the midrib.
    - **Compound Leaf:** The incisions of the lamina reach up to the midrib, breaking it into a number of leaflets.
        - **Pinnately Compound:** Leaflets are present on a common axis, the rachis. e.g., Neem.
        - **Palmately Compound:** Leaflets are attached at a common point, i.e., at the tip of the petiole. e.g., Silk Cotton.
- **Phyllotaxy:** The pattern of arrangement of leaves on the stem or a branch.
    - **Alternate:** A single leaf arises at each node in an alternate manner. e.g., China rose, Mustard.
    - **Opposite:** A pair of leaves arise at each node and lie opposite to each other. e.g., *Calotropis*, Guava.
    - **Whorled:** More than two leaves arise at a node and form a whorl. e.g., *Alstonia*.
- **Modifications of Leaves:**
    - **Tendrils:** For climbing. e.g., Peas.
    - **Spines:** For defense. e.g., Cacti.
    - **Storage:** Fleshy leaves of onion and garlic.
    - **Insectivorous:** Pitcher plant, Venus flytrap.

## 4. Inflorescence
- **Definition:** The arrangement of flowers on the floral axis.
- **Types:**
    - **Racemose:** The main axis continues to grow, and the flowers are borne laterally in an acropetal succession (older flowers at the base, younger ones at the top). e.g., Radish, Mustard.
    - **Cymose:** The main axis terminates in a flower, hence is limited in growth. The flowers are borne in a basipetal order (older flowers at the top, younger ones at the base). e.g., Jasmine, *Calotropis*.

## 5. The Flower
- **Definition:** The reproductive unit in the angiosperms.
- **Structure:** A typical flower has four whorls of appendages attached to the receptacle: calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium.
- **Symmetry:**
    - **Actinomorphic (Radial):** Can be divided into two equal radial halves in any radial plane passing through the center. e.g., Mustard, *Datura*, Chilli.
    - **Zygomorphic (Bilateral):** Can be divided into two similar halves only in one particular vertical plane. e.g., Pea, Gulmohar, Bean, *Cassia*.
- **Parts of a Flower:**
    - **Calyx:** The outermost whorl, composed of sepals. Usually green, leaf-like and protect the flower in the bud stage.
    - **Corolla:** Composed of petals. Usually brightly colored to attract insects for pollination.
    - **Aestivation:** The mode of arrangement of sepals or petals in a floral bud.
        - **Valvate:** Sepals or petals in a whorl just touch one another at the margin, without overlapping. e.g., *Calotropis*.
        - **Twisted:** One margin of the appendage overlaps that of the next one. e.g., China rose, Lady's finger.
        - **Imbricate:** The margins of sepals or petals overlap one another but not in any particular direction. e.g., *Cassia*, Gulmohar.
        - **Vexillary:** The largest petal (standard) overlaps the two lateral petals (wings) which in turn overlap the two smallest anterior petals (keel). e.g., Pea, Bean.
    - **Androecium:** Composed of stamens. Each stamen consists of a filament and an anther.
    - **Gynoecium (Pistil):** The female reproductive part, composed of one or more carpels. Each carpel has three parts: stigma, style, and ovary.
- **Placentation:** The arrangement of ovules within the ovary.
    - **Marginal:** e.g., Pea
    - **Axile:** e.g., China rose, Tomato, Lemon
    - **Parietal:** e.g., Mustard, *Argemone*
    - **Free Central:** e.g., *Dianthus*, *Primrose*
    - **Basal:** e.g., Sunflower, Marigold
