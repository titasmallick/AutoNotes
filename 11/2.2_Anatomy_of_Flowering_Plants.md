# Chapter 2.2: Anatomy of Flowering Plants

## 1. Plant Tissues
- **Definition:** A group of cells having a common origin and usually performing a common function.
- **Types:**
    - **Meristematic Tissues:** Consist of actively dividing cells.
        - **Apical Meristems:** Found at the tips of roots and shoots. Responsible for primary growth (increase in length).
        - **Intercalary Meristems:** Found in between mature tissues. Common in grasses.
        - **Lateral Meristems:** Found in the mature regions of roots and shoots. Responsible for secondary growth (increase in girth). e.g., Vascular cambium, Cork cambium.
    - **Permanent Tissues:** Consist of cells that have lost the ability to divide.
        - **Simple Tissues:** Made of only one type of cells.
            - **Parenchyma:** Composed of isodiametric, thin-walled cells with intercellular spaces. Performs functions like photosynthesis, storage, secretion.
            - **Collenchyma:** Composed of cells which are thickened at the corners due to deposition of cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin. Provides mechanical support to growing parts of the plant like young stem and petiole of a leaf.
            - **Sclerenchyma:** Composed of long, narrow cells with thick and lignified cell walls. Provides mechanical support to organs. Can be either fibres or sclereids.
        - **Complex Tissues:** Made of more than one type of cells.
            - **Xylem:** Conducts water and minerals from roots to the stem and leaves. Also provides mechanical strength. Composed of four different kinds of elements: tracheids, vessels, xylem fibres and xylem parenchyma.
            - **Phloem:** Transports food materials, usually from leaves to other parts of the plant. Composed of four elements: sieve tube elements, companion cells, phloem parenchyma and phloem fibres.

## 2. The Tissue System
- **Epidermal Tissue System:** Forms the outermost covering of the whole plant body. Comprises epidermal cells, stomata and the epidermal appendages â€“ trichomes and hairs.
- **Ground Tissue System:** All tissues except epidermis and vascular bundles constitute the ground tissue. It consists of simple tissues such as parenchyma, collenchyma and sclerenchyma.
- **Vascular Tissue System:** Consists of complex tissues, the phloem and the xylem. The xylem and phloem are together called a vascular bundle.

## 3. Anatomy of Dicotyledonous and Monocotyledonous Plants

### Dicot Root
- **Epidermis:** Outermost layer with unicellular root hairs.
- **Cortex:** Consists of several layers of thin-walled parenchyma cells.
- **Endodermis:** Innermost layer of the cortex, with Casparian strips (impermeable to water).
- **Stele:** All tissues on the inner side of the endodermis. Includes the pericycle, vascular bundles and pith.
- **Vascular Bundles:** Radial arrangement (xylem and phloem on different radii). Xylem is exarch (protoxylem towards the periphery). Usually 2 to 4 xylem and phloem patches.
- **Pith:** Small or inconspicuous.

### Monocot Root
- Similar to dicot root in many respects.
- **Differences:**
    - **Vascular Bundles:** Usually more than six (polyarch) xylem bundles.
    - **Pith:** Large and well developed.
    - No secondary growth.

### Dicot Stem
- **Epidermis:** Outermost protective layer, covered with a thin layer of cuticle. May bear trichomes and a few stomata.
- **Cortex:** Divided into three sub-zones: the outer hypodermis (collenchymatous), the middle cortical layers (parenchymatous) and the inner endodermis.
- **Stele:** Pericycle is present on the inner side of the endodermis and above the phloem in the form of semi-lunar patches of sclerenchyma.
- **Vascular Bundles:** Arranged in a ring. Conjoint, collateral, and open (cambium is present between phloem and xylem).
- **Pith:** A large number of rounded, parenchymatous cells with large intercellular spaces which occupy the central portion of the stem.

### Monocot Stem
- **Hypodermis:** Sclerenchymatous.
- **Vascular Bundles:** Scattered throughout the ground tissue, each surrounded by a sclerenchymatous bundle sheath. Conjoint, collateral, and closed (cambium is absent).
- **Ground Tissue:** A large, conspicuous parenchymatous ground tissue.
- **Pith:** Not distinct.

### Dicot Leaf (Dorsiventral)
- **Epidermis:** Adaxial (upper) and abaxial (lower) epidermis. The abaxial epidermis generally bears more stomata.
- **Mesophyll:** The tissue between the upper and the lower epidermis. Differentiated into palisade parenchyma (upper, elongated cells) and spongy parenchyma (lower, loosely arranged cells with large air cavities).
- **Vascular System:** Vascular bundles are seen in the veins and the midrib. They are surrounded by a layer of thick-walled bundle sheath cells.

### Monocot Leaf (Isobilateral)
- **Stomata:** Present on both surfaces of the epidermis.
- **Mesophyll:** Not differentiated into palisade and spongy parenchyma.
- **Bulliform cells:** In grasses, certain adaxial epidermal cells along the veins modify themselves into large, empty, colourless cells. When they are flaccid due to water stress, they make the leaves curl inwards to minimize water loss.
