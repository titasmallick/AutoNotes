# Chapter 5.1: Breathing and Exchange of Gases

## 1. Human Respiratory System
- **Organs:**
    - **External Nostrils:** Open into the nasal chamber.
    - **Nasal Chamber:** Leads to the pharynx.
    - **Pharynx:** Common passage for food and air.
    - **Larynx (Voice Box):** Contains vocal cords, responsible for sound production.
    - **Trachea (Windpipe):** A straight tube extending up to the mid-thoracic cavity, which divides at the 5th thoracic vertebra into right and left primary bronchi.
    - **Bronchi:** Primary bronchi divide into secondary and tertiary bronchi, and then into bronchioles.
    - **Bronchioles:** End up in very thin, irregular-walled vascularised bag-like structures called alveoli.
    - **Lungs:** Two lungs, enclosed by a double-layered pleura. The outer pleural membrane is in close contact with the thoracic lining, while the inner pleural membrane is in contact with the lung surface. The fluid between the two pleural membranes is called pleural fluid, which reduces friction on the lung surface.
- **Respiratory Zone:** Alveoli and their ducts.
- **Conducting Zone:** From external nostrils up to the terminal bronchioles. It transports the air to the alveoli, clears it from foreign particles, humidifies and brings the air to body temperature.

## 2. Mechanism of Breathing
- **Breathing:** Involves two stages: inspiration (inhalation) and expiration (exhalation).
- **Inspiration:**
    - Diaphragm contracts (flattens).
    - External intercostal muscles contract, pulling the ribs and sternum upwards and outwards.
    - This increases the volume of the thoracic cavity in the antero-posterior and dorso-ventral axes.
    - The increase in thoracic volume leads to a decrease in intra-pulmonary pressure (pressure inside the lungs) below the atmospheric pressure.
    - Air rushes into the lungs.
- **Expiration:**
    - Diaphragm relaxes (becomes dome-shaped).
    - External intercostal muscles relax, allowing the ribs and sternum to return to their original position.
    - This decreases the volume of the thoracic cavity.
    - The decrease in thoracic volume leads to an increase in intra-pulmonary pressure above the atmospheric pressure.
    - Air is expelled from the lungs.

## 3. Pulmonary Gas Exchange
- **Site:** Alveoli and tissues.
- **Factors Affecting Diffusion:** Partial pressure of gases, solubility of gases, thickness of the diffusion membrane.
- **Partial Pressure:** The pressure contributed by an individual gas in a mixture of gases.
    - **Alveoli:** PO₂ is high (104 mmHg), PCO₂ is low (40 mmHg).
    - **Deoxygenated Blood:** PO₂ is low (40 mmHg), PCO₂ is high (45 mmHg).
    - **Oxygenated Blood:** PO₂ is high (95 mmHg), PCO₂ is low (40 mmHg).
    - **Tissues:** PO₂ is low (40 mmHg), PCO₂ is high (45 mmHg).

## 4. Gas Transport

### Oxygen Transport
- **By Haemoglobin:** 97% of O₂ is transported by red blood cells (RBCs) as oxyhaemoglobin.
- **Dissociation Curve (Oxyhaemoglobin Dissociation Curve):** A sigmoid curve that shows the relationship between the partial pressure of oxygen (PO₂) and the percentage saturation of haemoglobin with oxygen.
    - **Factors Affecting Curve Shift:**
        - **Right Shift (Decreased Affinity):** High PCO₂, high H⁺ concentration (low pH), high temperature, high 2,3-BPG. Occurs in tissues, facilitating O₂ release.
        - **Left Shift (Increased Affinity):** Low PCO₂, low H⁺ concentration (high pH), low temperature, low 2,3-BPG. Occurs in lungs, facilitating O₂ binding.
- **By Plasma:** 3% of O₂ is transported in a dissolved state through plasma.

### Carbon Dioxide Transport
- **By Plasma:** 7% of CO₂ is transported in a dissolved state through plasma.
- **By Bicarbonates:** 70% of CO₂ is transported as bicarbonate ions (HCO₃⁻) in the plasma.
- **By Haemoglobin:** 23% of CO₂ is transported by RBCs as carbamino-haemoglobin.

## 5. Lung Volumes and Capacities
- **Tidal Volume (TV):** Volume of air inspired or expired during a normal respiration (approx. 500 mL).
- **Inspiratory Reserve Volume (IRV):** Additional volume of air that can be inspired by a forceful inspiration (approx. 2500-3000 mL).
- **Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV):** Additional volume of air that can be expired by a forceful expiration (approx. 1000-1100 mL).
- **Residual Volume (RV):** Volume of air remaining in the lungs even after a forceful expiration (approx. 1100-1200 mL).
- **Inspiratory Capacity (IC):** TV + IRV.
- **Expiratory Capacity (EC):** TV + ERV.
- **Functional Residual Capacity (FRC):** ERV + RV.
- **Vital Capacity (VC):** IRV + ERV + TV (or IC + ERV).
- **Total Lung Capacity (TLC):** VC + RV (or IRV + ERV + TV + RV).

## 6. Disorders of Respiratory System
- **Asthma:** Difficulty in breathing causing wheezing due to inflammation of bronchi and bronchioles.
- **Emphysema:** A chronic disorder in which alveolar walls are damaged, leading to a decrease in the respiratory surface. Caused by cigarette smoking.
- **Occupational Respiratory Disorders:** Caused by prolonged exposure to dust in certain industries (e.g., silicosis, asbestosis). Leads to inflammation and fibrosis of lung tissue.
