# Chapter 4.1: Photosynthesis in Higher Plants

## 1. Autotrophic Nutrition
- **Definition:** The mode of nutrition in which organisms synthesize their own food from simple inorganic substances like CO₂ and water, using light energy (photoautotrophs) or chemical energy (chemoautotrophs).
- **Photosynthesis:** The process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water. Chlorophyll, other pigments, and enzymes play a crucial role.

## 2. Photosynthetic Pigments
- **Chlorophylls:** Green pigments (chlorophyll a and b) that absorb light energy, primarily in the blue and red regions of the spectrum.
- **Carotenoids:** Yellow, orange, or red pigments (carotene and xanthophylls) that absorb light in regions not absorbed by chlorophyll and protect chlorophyll from photo-oxidation.

## 3. Site of Photosynthesis: Chloroplasts
- Photosynthesis takes place in the chloroplasts, specifically in the thylakoids (light-dependent reactions) and the stroma (light-independent reactions).

## 4. Photochemical and Biosynthetic Phases
- **Photochemical Phase (Light-Dependent Reactions):**
    - Occurs in the thylakoid membranes.
    - Light energy is absorbed by photosynthetic pigments.
    - Water is split (photolysis) to release O₂, protons, and electrons.
    - ATP and NADPH are produced (energy carriers).
- **Biosynthetic Phase (Light-Independent Reactions / Calvin Cycle):**
    - Occurs in the stroma of the chloroplast.
    - ATP and NADPH (from the light reactions) are used to fix CO₂ and synthesize sugars.

## 5. Photophosphorylation
- The process of ATP synthesis from ADP and inorganic phosphate in the presence of light.
- **Cyclic Photophosphorylation:**
    - Only Photosystem I (PSI) is involved.
    - Electrons are recycled back to PSI.
    - Only ATP is produced, no NADPH or O₂.
    - Occurs when only light of wavelengths beyond 680 nm is available.
- **Non-Cyclic Photophosphorylation (Z-scheme):**
    - Both Photosystem I (PSI) and Photosystem II (PSII) are involved.
    - Electrons are not recycled; they are transferred from PSII to PSI and then to NADP⁺.
    - Produces ATP, NADPH, and O₂ (from water splitting).

## 6. Chemiosmotic Hypothesis
- Proposed by Peter Mitchell. Explains how ATP is synthesized in chloroplasts (and mitochondria).
- It is based on the development of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane.
- The proton gradient is created by:
    - Splitting of water molecules on the inner side of the membrane.
    - Movement of protons by the primary electron acceptor.
    - Movement of electrons through the electron transport system.
- The breakdown of this proton gradient through the F₀-F₁ ATPase complex leads to ATP synthesis.

## 7. C₃ and C₄ Pathways

### C₃ Pathway (Calvin Cycle)
- **Characteristics:**
    - The first stable product of CO₂ fixation is a 3-carbon compound, 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3-PGA).
    - The primary CO₂ acceptor is RuBP (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate), a 5-carbon compound.
    - The enzyme responsible for CO₂ fixation is RuBisCO (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase).
    - Occurs in mesophyll cells.
    - Most plants are C₃ plants.

### C₄ Pathway
- **Characteristics:**
    - The first stable product of CO₂ fixation is a 4-carbon compound, oxaloacetic acid (OAA).
    - The primary CO₂ acceptor is PEP (phosphoenolpyruvate), a 3-carbon compound.
    - The enzyme responsible for CO₂ fixation is PEP carboxylase (PEPcase).
    - **Kranz Anatomy:** A characteristic anatomy of C₄ plants where the vascular bundles are surrounded by large bundle sheath cells. These cells have a large number of chloroplasts, thick walls, and no intercellular spaces.
    - The C₄ pathway occurs in two types of cells: mesophyll cells and bundle sheath cells.
    - Examples: Maize, Sugarcane, Sorghum.

## 8. Photorespiration and RuBisCO
- **Photorespiration:** A wasteful process that occurs in C₃ plants when RuBisCO binds with O₂ instead of CO₂.
    - RuBisCO has a higher affinity for CO₂ than for O₂. However, at high O₂ concentrations, it can bind to O₂.
    - This leads to the formation of one molecule of phosphoglycolate (2-carbon) and one molecule of PGA (3-carbon).
    - Phosphoglycolate is then metabolized, releasing CO₂ and consuming ATP, without producing sugar or ATP/NADPH.
    - C₄ plants avoid photorespiration due to Kranz anatomy and the presence of PEPcase in mesophyll cells, which efficiently fixes CO₂ at low concentrations.

## 9. Factors Affecting Photosynthesis
- **Blackman's Law of Limiting Factors:** If a chemical process is affected by more than one factor, then its rate is determined by the factor which is nearest to its minimal value.
- **External Factors:**
    - **Light:** Light intensity, quality, and duration.
    - **Carbon Dioxide Concentration:** CO₂ is a major limiting factor.
    - **Temperature:** Affects enzyme activity.
    - **Water:** Water stress causes stomata to close, reducing CO₂ availability.
- **Internal Factors:**
    - **Number, size, age, and orientation of leaves.**
    - **Mesophyll cells and chloroplasts.**
    - **Internal CO₂ concentration.**
    - **Amount of chlorophyll.**
