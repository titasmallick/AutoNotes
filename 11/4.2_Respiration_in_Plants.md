# Chapter 4.2: Respiration in Plants

## 1. Introduction
- **Respiration:** The process of oxidation of organic compounds (food) in a cell to release energy in the form of ATP. This energy is then used for various metabolic activities.
- **Respiratory Substrates:** The compounds that are oxidised during respiration. These include carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and organic acids.

## 2. Glycolysis (EMP Pathway)
- **Definition:** The partial oxidation of glucose to two molecules of pyruvic acid. It occurs in the cytoplasm and does not require oxygen.
- **Steps:** A 10-step pathway involving various enzymes.
- **Net Gain:** 2 ATP molecules (by substrate-level phosphorylation) and 2 NADH molecules.

## 3. Fermentation
- **Definition:** Anaerobic respiration that occurs in the absence of oxygen. Pyruvic acid is converted into either lactic acid or ethanol and CO₂.
- **Types:**
    - **Alcoholic Fermentation:** Pyruvic acid is converted to ethanol and CO₂ by yeast. e.g., in brewing and baking industries.
    - **Lactic Acid Fermentation:** Pyruvic acid is converted to lactic acid by lactic acid bacteria and in muscle cells during strenuous exercise.
- **Energy Yield:** Very less energy is released (less than 7% of the energy in glucose).

## 4. Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) Cycle / Krebs Cycle / Citric Acid Cycle
- **Definition:** The complete oxidation of pyruvic acid (after conversion to acetyl CoA) to CO₂ and water. It occurs in the mitochondrial matrix.
- **Link Reaction:** Pyruvic acid is decarboxylated and oxidised to acetyl CoA, which then enters the TCA cycle.
- **Steps:** A cyclic pathway involving several enzymatic reactions.
- **Net Gain (per glucose molecule):** 6 NADH, 2 FADH₂, 2 ATP (or GTP).

## 5. Electron Transport System (ETS) and Oxidative Phosphorylation
- **ETS:** A series of electron carriers located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Electrons from NADH and FADH₂ are passed down the chain, releasing energy.
- **Oxidative Phosphorylation:** The synthesis of ATP using the energy released from the oxidation of NADH and FADH₂ during the electron transport chain. This process requires oxygen as the final electron acceptor.
- **ATP Yield:** For each NADH molecule, approximately 3 ATPs are produced. For each FADH₂ molecule, approximately 2 ATPs are produced.
- **Overall ATP Production (from one glucose molecule):** Approximately 36 or 38 ATP molecules.

## 6. Amphibolic Pathways
- **Definition:** Metabolic pathways that involve both catabolism (breakdown) and anabolism (synthesis). Respiration is an amphibolic pathway.
- **Examples:**
    - **Catabolism:** Breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins to produce energy.
    - **Anabolism:** Intermediates of the respiratory pathway can be used for the synthesis of other molecules (e.g., fatty acids from acetyl CoA, proteins from amino acids).

## 7. Respiratory Quotient (RQ)
- **Definition:** The ratio of the volume of CO₂ evolved to the volume of O₂ consumed during respiration.
- **Formula:** RQ = Volume of CO₂ evolved / Volume of O₂ consumed
- **Values for different respiratory substrates:**
    - **Carbohydrates:** RQ = 1 (e.g., C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O)
    - **Fats:** RQ < 1 (e.g., Tripalmitin: 0.7)
    - **Proteins:** RQ < 1 (approximately 0.9)
    - **Organic Acids:** RQ > 1 (e.g., Oxalic acid: 4)
