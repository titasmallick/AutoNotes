# Chapter 3.3: Cell Cycle and Cell Division

## 1. Cell Cycle
- **Definition:** The sequence of events by which a cell duplicates its genome, synthesizes the other constituents of the cell and eventually divides into two daughter cells.
- **Phases:** The cell cycle is divided into two basic phases:
    - **Interphase:** The phase between two successive M phases. It is the resting phase during which the cell is preparing for division by undergoing both cell growth and DNA replication.
        - **G₁ Phase (Gap 1):** The interval between mitosis and initiation of DNA replication. The cell is metabolically active and continuously grows.
        - **S Phase (Synthesis):** The period during which DNA synthesis or replication takes place. The amount of DNA per cell doubles.
        - **G₂ Phase (Gap 2):** The period during which proteins are synthesized in preparation for mitosis while cell growth continues.
    - **M Phase (Mitosis Phase):** The phase where the actual cell division or mitosis occurs. It starts with the nuclear division, corresponding to the separation of daughter chromosomes (karyokinesis) and usually ends with division of cytoplasm (cytokinesis).

## 2. Mitosis (Equational Division)
- **Definition:** A type of cell division in which a parent cell divides into two genetically identical daughter cells. The chromosome number in the daughter cells is the same as that in the parent cell.
- **Stages:**
    - **Prophase:** Condensation of chromatin material into compact mitotic chromosomes. Initiation of the assembly of the mitotic spindle. The nuclear envelope disintegrates.
    - **Metaphase:** The chromosomes, now consisting of two sister chromatids, align at the metaphase plate (equator). The spindle fibres attach to the kinetochores of the chromosomes.
    - **Anaphase:** The centromeres split and the sister chromatids separate, moving to opposite poles of the cell.
    - **Telophase:** The chromosomes decondense and lose their individuality. The nuclear envelope reassembles around the chromosome clusters at each pole.
- **Cytokinesis:** The division of the cytoplasm, which usually follows karyokinesis. In animal cells, it occurs by the formation of a cleavage furrow. In plant cells, it occurs by the formation of a cell plate.
- **Significance:** Growth, repair, and asexual reproduction.

## 3. Meiosis (Reductional Division)
- **Definition:** A type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, producing four haploid daughter cells. It occurs in diploid organisms to form gametes.
- **Stages:** Meiosis involves two sequential cycles of nuclear and cell division called meiosis I and meiosis II but only a single cycle of DNA replication.

### Meiosis I
- **Prophase I:** The longest phase of meiosis. It is subdivided into five phases:
    - **Leptotene:** Chromosomes become gradually visible under the light microscope.
    - **Zygotene:** Pairing of homologous chromosomes (synapsis). The paired chromosomes are called bivalents.
    - **Pachytene:** Crossing over occurs between non-sister chromatids of the homologous chromosomes. This is the exchange of genetic material, which leads to recombination.
    - **Diplotene:** The synaptonemal complex dissolves, and the homologous chromosomes of the bivalents separate from each other except at the sites of crossovers. These X-shaped structures are called chiasmata.
    - **Diakinesis:** The chiasmata terminalize. The nuclear envelope breaks down.
- **Metaphase I:** The bivalents align on the equatorial plate.
- **Anaphase I:** The homologous chromosomes separate, while sister chromatids remain associated at their centromeres.
- **Telophase I:** The nuclear membrane and nucleolus reappear, cytokinesis follows, and this is called as a dyad of cells.

### Meiosis II
- It is similar to mitosis.
- **Prophase II:** The nuclear envelope disappears.
- **Metaphase II:** The chromosomes align at the equator.
- **Anaphase II:** The centromeres split, and the sister chromatids move to opposite poles.
- **Telophase II:** The nuclear envelope reforms, and cytokinesis follows, resulting in four haploid daughter cells (tetrad).

- **Significance:**
    - Formation of gametes for sexual reproduction.
    - Maintains the chromosome number in a species.
    - Introduces genetic variation.

## 4. Differences between Mitosis and Meiosis

| Feature | Mitosis | Meiosis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Occurrence** | In somatic cells | In germ cells |
| **No. of Divisions** | One | Two (Meiosis I and Meiosis II) |
| **Synapsis** | Does not occur | Occurs during Prophase I |
| **Crossing Over** | Absent | Occurs during Prophase I |
| **No. of Daughter Cells** | Two | Four |
| **Ploidy of Daughter Cells** | Diploid (2n) | Haploid (n) |
| **Genetic Identity** | Daughter cells are genetically identical to the parent cell | Daughter cells are genetically different from the parent cell |

## 5. C-value
- **Definition:** The amount, in picograms, of DNA contained within a haploid nucleus of a eukaryotic organism. It is a measure of genome size.
