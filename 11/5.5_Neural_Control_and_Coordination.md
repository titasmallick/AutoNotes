### Neurons: Types, Structure

#### Structure of a Neuron
A neuron (nerve cell) is the structural and functional unit of the nervous system. It is specialized to transmit electrical signals called nerve impulses. A typical neuron consists of three main parts:

1.  **Cell Body (Soma/Perikaryon):**
    *   Contains the nucleus and other typical cell organelles (e.g., mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum).
    *   Nissl's granules (rough endoplasmic reticulum and free ribosomes) are characteristic of neurons and are involved in protein synthesis.
    *   The cell body is primarily involved in the metabolic maintenance of the neuron.

2.  **Dendrites:**
    *   Short, branched, tree-like processes extending from the cell body.
    *   Receive nerve impulses from other neurons and transmit them towards the cell body.
    *   Their branched structure increases the surface area for receiving signals.

3.  **Axon:**
    *   A single, long, slender projection that extends from the cell body at a region called the axon hillock.
    *   Transmits nerve impulses away from the cell body to other neurons, muscles, or glands.
    *   The terminal end of the axon branches into axon terminals (telodendria), which end in synaptic knobs (boutons) containing neurotransmitters.
    *   **Myelin Sheath:** Many axons are covered by a fatty insulating layer called the myelin sheath, formed by Schwann cells (in PNS) or oligodendrocytes (in CNS). The myelin sheath speeds up nerve impulse conduction (saltatory conduction).
    *   **Nodes of Ranvier:** Gaps in the myelin sheath along the axon, where the nerve impulse jumps from node to node.

#### Types of Neurons (Based on Structure)

1.  **Multipolar:** Have one axon and two or more dendrites. Most common type in the cerebral cortex.
2.  **Bipolar:** Have one axon and one dendrite. Found in the retina of the eye and olfactory epithelium.
3.  **Unipolar:** Have a single process extending from the cell body, which then divides into an axonal and a dendritic branch. Found in the dorsal root ganglia of spinal nerves.
4.  **Pseudounipolar:** A variation of unipolar where the single process immediately divides into two, one going to the periphery and the other to the CNS. Functionally unipolar.

#### Types of Neurons (Based on Function)

1.  **Sensory (Afferent) Neurons:** Transmit impulses from sensory receptors (e.g., skin, eyes) towards the central nervous system (CNS).
2.  **Motor (Efferent) Neurons:** Transmit impulses from the CNS to effector organs (muscles or glands).
3.  **Interneurons (Association Neurons):** Located entirely within the CNS, they connect sensory and motor neurons, integrating information.

### Nervous System: CNS, PNS, Conduction of Impulses

#### Divisions of the Nervous System

The human nervous system is broadly divided into two main parts:

1.  **Central Nervous System (CNS):**
    *   Comprises the **brain** and **spinal cord**.
    *   The primary site for processing information, integrating sensory input, and initiating motor output.
    *   Protected by meninges (dura mater, arachnoid mater, pia mater) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

2.  **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS):**
    *   Consists of all the nerves extending from the CNS to the rest of the body.
    *   Includes **cranial nerves** (arising from the brain) and **spinal nerves** (arising from the spinal cord).
    *   Further divided into:
        *   **Somatic Nervous System (SNS):** Controls voluntary movements by transmitting signals from the CNS to skeletal muscles.
        *   **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS):** Controls involuntary functions of internal organs (e.g., heart rate, digestion, respiration). It is further subdivided into:
            *   **Sympathetic Nervous System:** Prepares the body for "fight or flight" responses (e.g., increased heart rate, dilated pupils).
            *   **Parasympathetic Nervous System:** Promotes "rest and digest" activities (e.g., decreased heart rate, stimulated digestion).

#### Conduction of Nerve Impulses

Nerve impulses (action potentials) are electrical signals that travel along the neuron's membrane.

1.  **Resting Membrane Potential:**
    *   In a resting neuron, the inside of the membrane is negatively charged relative to the outside.
    *   This is maintained by the **sodium-potassium pump** (actively transports 3 Na+ ions out for every 2 K+ ions in) and the differential permeability of the membrane to Na+ and K+ ions (more K+ leak channels than Na+).

2.  **Depolarization:**
    *   When a stimulus reaches the neuron, voltage-gated Na+ channels open, allowing Na+ ions to rush into the cell.
    *   The influx of positive ions makes the inside of the membrane less negative (more positive), reaching a threshold potential.

3.  **Repolarization:**
    *   Once the peak of depolarization is reached, voltage-gated Na+ channels inactivate, and voltage-gated K+ channels open.
    *   K+ ions rush out of the cell, making the inside of the membrane negative again.

4.  **Hyperpolarization (Refractory Period):**
    *   K+ channels close slowly, leading to a brief period where the membrane potential becomes even more negative than the resting potential.
    *   During this refractory period, the neuron is less responsive to further stimulation, ensuring unidirectional impulse flow.

5.  **Propagation of Action Potential:**
    *   The action potential generated at one point on the axon membrane triggers the opening of voltage-gated channels in the adjacent region, thus propagating the impulse along the axon.
    *   **Myelinated Axons (Saltatory Conduction):** In myelinated axons, the impulse jumps from one Node of Ranvier to the next, significantly increasing the speed of conduction.
    *   **Unmyelinated Axons (Continuous Conduction):** In unmyelinated axons, the impulse travels continuously along the membrane, which is slower.

6.  **Synaptic Transmission:**
    *   When the action potential reaches the axon terminal, it triggers the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft (the space between neurons).
    *   Neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, causing either excitation or inhibition, and thus transmitting the signal to the next neuron.

### Brain Parts, Reflex Arc

#### Parts of the Human Brain

The human brain is a complex organ, divided into three major parts:

1.  **Forebrain (Prosencephalon):**
    *   **Cerebrum:** The largest part of the brain, responsible for voluntary actions, intelligence, memory, consciousness, and sensory perception. It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres connected by the corpus callosum. The outer layer is the cerebral cortex (grey matter), and the inner part is white matter.
    *   **Thalamus:** A major relay station for sensory impulses (except smell) to the cerebral cortex.
    *   **Hypothalamus:** Located at the base of the thalamus, it controls body temperature, hunger, thirst, emotions, and regulates the pituitary gland (endocrine functions).

2.  **Midbrain (Mesencephalon):**
    *   Located between the thalamus/hypothalamus and the pons.
    *   Contains the **corpora quadrigemina** (four rounded swellings) involved in visual and auditory reflexes.
    *   Connects the forebrain and hindbrain.

3.  **Hindbrain (Rhombencephalon):**
    *   **Pons:** A bridge of nerve fibers connecting different regions of the brain, particularly involved in respiration and sleep.
    *   **Cerebellum:** Located behind the cerebrum, it coordinates voluntary movements, maintains posture, balance, and muscle tone.
    *   **Medulla Oblongata:** Connects the brain to the spinal cord. Controls vital involuntary functions like breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, swallowing, and vomiting.

#### Reflex Arc

A reflex arc is the neural pathway that mediates a reflex action. A reflex action is a rapid, involuntary, and unconscious response to a stimulus.

**Components of a Reflex Arc:**

1.  **Receptor:** Detects the stimulus (e.g., pain receptors in the skin).
2.  **Afferent Neuron (Sensory Neuron):** Transmits sensory impulses from the receptor to the CNS (spinal cord).
3.  **Interneuron (Relay Neuron/Association Neuron):** Located in the CNS (spinal cord), it processes the information and transmits the impulse to the efferent neuron. (In some simple reflex arcs, like the stretch reflex, an interneuron may be absent, and the sensory neuron directly synapses with the motor neuron).
4.  **Efferent Neuron (Motor Neuron):** Transmits motor impulses from the CNS to the effector organ.
5.  **Effector:** A muscle or gland that responds to the motor impulse (e.g., muscle contracting to withdraw a limb).

**Example: Knee-jerk Reflex (Monosynaptic Reflex)**
When the patellar tendon is tapped, the stretch receptors in the quadriceps muscle are stimulated. The sensory neuron directly synapses with the motor neuron in the spinal cord, which then causes the quadriceps muscle to contract, leading to the knee-jerk. This is a monosynaptic reflex as there is only one synapse between the sensory and motor neuron.

**Example: Withdrawal Reflex (Polysynaptic Reflex)**
When a hand touches a hot object, pain receptors are stimulated. The sensory neuron transmits the impulse to the spinal cord. Here, it synapses with an interneuron, which then synapses with a motor neuron. The motor neuron causes the arm muscles to contract, withdrawing the hand. This is a polysynaptic reflex as it involves more than one synapse and an interneuron.
