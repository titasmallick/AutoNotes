# Chapter 4.3: Plant Growth and Development

## 1. Seed Germination
- **Definition:** The process by which a seed embryo develops into a seedling.
- **Types of Germination:**
    - **Hypogeal Germination:** The epicotyl elongates, and the cotyledons remain below the soil surface. e.g., Pea, Maize, Rice.
    - **Epigeal Germination:** The hypocotyl elongates, and the cotyledons are pushed above the soil surface. e.g., Bean, Castor, Sunflower.
    - **Viviparous Germination:** Seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. Occurs in some mangrove plants. e.g., *Rhizophora*, *Sonneratia*.

## 2. Growth
- **Definition:** An irreversible increase in size, mass, or volume of a cell, organ, or whole organism.
- **Phases of Growth:**
    - **Meristematic Phase:** Cells are continuously dividing, rich in protoplasm, and have large nuclei.
    - **Elongation Phase:** Cells increase in size, vacuolation occurs, and new cell wall material is deposited.
    - **Maturation Phase:** Cells attain their maximum size and differentiate into specialized tissues.
- **Growth Rate:** The increase in growth per unit time.
    - **Arithmetic Growth:** One daughter cell continues to divide, while the other differentiates and matures. A linear curve is obtained. e.g., Root elongating at a constant rate.
    - **Geometric Growth:** Both daughter cells retain the ability to divide. An S-shaped (sigmoid) curve is obtained. Typical for most biological systems.
- **Measurement of Growth:** Can be measured by increase in fresh weight, dry weight, length, area, volume, or cell number.
    - **Auxanometer:** An instrument used to measure the growth of plants in terms of length.

## 3. Differentiation, Dedifferentiation, and Redifferentiation
- **Differentiation:** The process by which cells originating from the meristematic tissues mature to perform specific functions. This leads to the formation of specialized tissues and organs.
- **Dedifferentiation:** The process by which differentiated cells regain the capacity to divide. e.g., Formation of interfascicular cambium and cork cambium from mature parenchyma cells.
- **Redifferentiation:** The process by which dedifferentiated cells again lose the capacity to divide and mature to perform specific functions.

## 4. Plant Hormones (Plant Growth Regulators - PGRs)
- **Definition:** Small, simple molecules of diverse chemical composition, which regulate plant growth and development.

### Auxin
- **Discovery:** First isolated from human urine. F.W. Went isolated auxin from tips of oat coleoptiles.
- **Physiological Effects:**
    - **Apical Dominance:** Promotes growth of apical bud and inhibits growth of lateral buds.
    - **Cell Elongation:** Promotes cell elongation in stems.
    - **Root Initiation:** Promotes root formation in stem cuttings.
    - **Parthenocarpy:** Induces fruit development without fertilization (e.g., in tomatoes).
    - **Weed Control:** 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) is a synthetic auxin used as a herbicide to kill dicot weeds.

### Gibberellins (GAs)
- **Discovery:** First isolated from the fungus *Gibberella fujikuroi* (causing 'bakane' disease in rice).
- **Physiological Effects:**
    - **Stem Elongation:** Causes an increase in the length of the axis, especially in grapes, apples, and sugarcane.
    - **Bolting:** Promotes sudden elongation of internodes just prior to flowering in rosette plants (e.g., cabbage).
    - **Seed Germination:** Breaks seed dormancy.
    - **Fruit Development:** Delays senescence.

### Cytokinins
- **Discovery:** First isolated from herring sperm DNA (kinetin).
- **Physiological Effects:**
    - **Cell Division:** Promotes cell division.
    - **Apical Dominance:** Helps to overcome apical dominance.
    - **Delay Senescence:** Delays leaf senescence (aging).
    - **Chloroplast Development:** Promotes chloroplast development in leaves.

### Ethylene
- **Nature:** Gaseous PGR.
- **Physiological Effects:**
    - **Fruit Ripening:** Promotes fruit ripening.
    - **Senescence and Abscission:** Promotes senescence and abscission of leaves and flowers.
    - **Horizontal Growth:** Causes horizontal growth of seedlings and swelling of the axis.
    - **Flowering:** Induces flowering in pineapple.

### Abscisic Acid (ABA)
- **Nature:** Growth inhibitor.
- **Physiological Effects:**
    - **Stomatal Closure:** Closes stomata during water stress.
    - **Seed Dormancy:** Induces seed dormancy.
    - **Abscission:** Promotes abscission of leaves and fruits.
    - **Stress Hormone:** Acts as a stress hormone, increasing the tolerance of plants to various kinds of stresses.

## 5. Applications of Plant Hormones
- **Auxins:** Used in horticulture for root initiation in stem cuttings, parthenocarpy, and as herbicides.
- **Gibberellins:** Used to increase the length of grapes, improve fruit shape, and speed up malting process in brewing industry.
- **Cytokinins:** Used in tissue culture for cell division and differentiation.
- **Ethylene:** Used for artificial ripening of fruits.
- **ABA:** Used to induce dormancy in seeds for storage.
