# Chapter 3.2: Biomolecules

## 1. Carbohydrates
- **Definition:** Polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones, or substances that yield these on hydrolysis. They are the main source of energy for living organisms.
- **Classification:**
    - **Monosaccharides (Simple Sugars):** Cannot be hydrolyzed further. General formula is (CH₂O)n.
        - **Examples:** Glucose, Fructose, Galactose, Ribose.
    - **Disaccharides:** Formed by the condensation of two monosaccharide units.
        - **Examples:**
            - **Sucrose (Cane Sugar):** Glucose + Fructose
            - **Lactose (Milk Sugar):** Glucose + Galactose
            - **Maltose (Malt Sugar):** Glucose + Glucose
    - **Polysaccharides (Complex Carbohydrates):** Long chains of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds.
        - **Starch:** Storage polysaccharide in plants. A polymer of glucose.
        - **Glycogen:** Storage polysaccharide in animals. A polymer of glucose.
        - **Cellulose:** Structural polysaccharide in plants, forming the cell wall. A polymer of glucose.
        - **Chitin:** Structural polysaccharide in fungi and the exoskeleton of arthropods.

## 2. Proteins
- **Definition:** Polymers of amino acids, linked by peptide bonds. They are the most abundant organic molecules in living systems and have a wide range of functions.
- **Amino Acids:**
    - **Structure:** An amino acid is a substituted methane, with four substituent groups occupying the four valency positions: a carboxyl group, an amino group, a hydrogen atom, and a variable group designated as R group.
    - **Types:** There are 20 different types of amino acids commonly found in proteins. They can be classified as acidic, basic, or neutral based on the nature of the R group.
- **Levels of Protein Structure:**
    - **Primary Structure:** The linear sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain.
    - **Secondary Structure:** The polypeptide chain is folded into regular structures like the α-helix and the β-pleated sheet. These structures are stabilized by hydrogen bonds.
    - **Tertiary Structure:** The overall three-dimensional shape of a polypeptide chain. It is stabilized by various types of bonds, including hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, disulfide bridges, and hydrophobic interactions.
    - **Quaternary Structure:** The arrangement of multiple polypeptide chains (subunits) in a protein. e.g., Haemoglobin.

## 3. Lipids
- **Definition:** A diverse group of organic compounds that are insoluble in water but soluble in nonpolar organic solvents. They include fats, oils, waxes, and steroids.
- **Types and Functions:**
    - **Fats and Oils (Triglycerides):** Composed of fatty acids and glycerol. They are the main form of energy storage in animals.
    - **Phospholipids:** A major component of cell membranes.
    - **Steroids:** Have a characteristic four-ring structure. Examples include cholesterol and steroid hormones (e.g., testosterone, estrogen).

## 4. Enzymes
- **Definition:** Biological catalysts that speed up the rate of biochemical reactions without being consumed in the reaction.
- **Properties:**
    - Almost all enzymes are proteins.
    - They are highly specific for their substrates.
    - They work best at a specific temperature and pH (optimum temperature and pH).
- **Nomenclature:** Enzymes are usually named by adding the suffix "-ase" to the name of the substrate they act on (e.g., sucrase, lactase).
- **Types:** Classified into 6 classes: Oxidoreductases, Transferases, Hydrolases, Lyases, Isomerases, and Ligases.
- **Cofactors:** Non-protein constituents bound to the enzyme to make it catalytically active. They can be prosthetic groups, co-enzymes, or metal ions.
- **Mechanism of Enzyme Action:**
    - An enzyme lowers the activation energy of a reaction, thereby increasing the rate of the reaction.
    - The enzyme binds to the substrate to form an enzyme-substrate complex (E-S complex).
    - **Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity:** Temperature, pH, concentration of substrate, and presence of inhibitors.

## 5. Secondary Metabolites
- **Definition:** Organic compounds that are not directly involved in the normal growth, development, or reproduction of an organism. They are often produced as by-products of metabolism.
- **Examples:**
    - **Alkaloids:** Morphine, Codeine
    - **Terpenoids:** Monoterpenes, Diterpenes
    - **Essential oils:** Lemon grass oil
    - **Toxins:** Abrin, Ricin
    - **Lectins:** Concanavalin A
    - **Drugs:** Vinblastin, Curcumin
    - **Polymeric substances:** Rubber, Gums, Cellulose
