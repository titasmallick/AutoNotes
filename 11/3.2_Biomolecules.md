# Chapter 3.2: Biomolecules

## 1. Carbohydrates
- **Definition:** Carbohydrates are polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones, or substances that yield these on hydrolysis. They are the most important source of energy for living organisms. They are also known as saccharides.
- **Classification:**
    - **Monosaccharides (Simple Sugars):** Cannot be hydrolyzed further. General formula is (CH₂O)n.
        - **Glucose:** A six-carbon sugar (hexose) that is the primary source of energy for most living organisms. It is an aldohexose, meaning it has an aldehyde group at position 1.
        - **Ribose:** A five-carbon sugar (pentose) that is a component of ribonucleic acid (RNA). It is an aldopentose.
        - **Deoxyribose:** A modified five-carbon sugar that is a component of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). It is derived from ribose by the removal of an oxygen atom from the second carbon.
    - **Disaccharides:** Formed by the condensation of two monosaccharide units, joined by a glycosidic bond.
        - **Maltose (Malt Sugar):** Composed of two glucose units. It is a reducing sugar.
        - **Lactose (Milk Sugar):** Composed of glucose and galactose. It is a reducing sugar and is found in milk.
        - **Sucrose (Cane Sugar):** Composed of glucose and fructose. It is a non-reducing sugar and is the common table sugar.
    - **Polysaccharides (Complex Carbohydrates):** Long chains of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds.
        - **Glycogen:** The main storage polysaccharide in animals, stored primarily in the liver and muscles. It is a branched polymer of glucose.
        - **Starch:** The main storage polysaccharide in plants. It is a mixture of two polymers: amylose (a linear polymer of glucose) and amylopectin (a branched polymer of glucose).
        - **Cellulose:** A structural polysaccharide that forms the cell wall of plants. It is a linear polymer of glucose with beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds, which makes it indigestible by most animals.
        - **Inulin:** A polymer of fructose, found in many plants, such as chicory. It is used as a prebiotic and a fat substitute.
        - **Chitin:** A structural polysaccharide found in the exoskeletons of arthropods and the cell walls of fungi. It is a polymer of N-acetylglucosamine.

## 2. Proteins
- **Definition:** Proteins are polymers of amino acids, linked by peptide bonds. They are the most abundant organic molecules in living systems and have a wide range of functions.
- **Amino Acids:**
    - **Structure:** An amino acid is a substituted methane, with four substituent groups occupying the four valency positions: a carboxyl group, an amino group, a hydrogen atom, and a variable group designated as R group.
        - **Glycine:** The simplest amino acid, with hydrogen as its R group.
        - **Alanine:** Has a methyl group as its R group.
        - **Serine:** Has a hydroxymethyl group as its R group.
    - **Zwitter-ion:** An amino acid can exist as a zwitter-ion, which is a molecule with both a positive and a negative charge. The amino group is protonated (-NH3+) and the carboxyl group is deprotonated (-COO-).
    - **Types:**
        - **Acidic:** Have an acidic R group (e.g., Aspartic acid, Glutamic acid).
        - **Basic:** Have a basic R group (e.g., Lysine, Arginine).
        - **Neutral:** Have a neutral R group (e.g., Glycine, Alanine, Valine).
        - **Sulphur-containing:** Contain a sulphur atom in the R group (e.g., Cysteine, Methionine).
    - **Essential and Non-essential Amino Acids:**
        - **Essential:** Cannot be synthesized by the body and must be obtained from the diet (e.g., Lysine, Leucine, Isoleucine).
        - **Non-essential:** Can be synthesized by the body (e.g., Glycine, Alanine, Serine).
- **Levels of Protein Structure:**
    - **Primary Structure:** The linear sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain.
    - **Secondary Structure:** The polypeptide chain is folded into regular structures like the α-helix and the β-pleated sheet. These structures are stabilized by hydrogen bonds.
    - **Tertiary Structure:** The overall three-dimensional shape of a polypeptide chain. It is stabilized by various types of bonds, including hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, disulfide bridges, and hydrophobic interactions.
    - **Quaternary Structure:** The arrangement of multiple polypeptide chains (subunits) in a protein. e.g., Haemoglobin.
- **Functions of Proteins:**
    - **Enzymes:** Catalyze biochemical reactions.
    - **Structural proteins:** Provide support and shape to cells and tissues (e.g., collagen, keratin).
    - **Transport proteins:** Carry substances across cell membranes or in the blood (e.g., hemoglobin).
    - **Hormones:** Regulate physiological processes (e.g., insulin).
    - **Antibodies:** Defend the body against pathogens.

## 3. Lipids
- **Definition:** A diverse group of organic compounds that are insoluble in water but soluble in nonpolar organic solvents.
- **Classification, Structure, and Functions of Fats and Oils:**
    - **Fats and Oils (Triglycerides):** Composed of three fatty acid molecules esterified to a glycerol molecule.
        - **Fats:** Solid at room temperature and are generally of animal origin. They are rich in saturated fatty acids.
        - **Oils:** Liquid at room temperature and are generally of plant origin. They are rich in unsaturated fatty acids.
    - **Functions:**
        - **Energy storage:** They are the main form of energy storage in animals.
        - **Insulation:** They provide thermal insulation.
        - **Protection:** They protect vital organs from shock.
        - **Source of fat-soluble vitamins:** They are a source of vitamins A, D, E, and K.

## 4. Enzymes
- **Definition:** Biological catalysts that speed up the rate of biochemical reactions without being consumed in the reaction.
- **General Properties:**
    - Almost all enzymes are proteins.
    - They are highly specific for their substrates.
    - They work best at a specific temperature and pH (optimum temperature and pH).
    - They are required in small amounts.
- **Nomenclature and Classification:**
    - **Nomenclature:** Enzymes are usually named by adding the suffix "-ase" to the name of the substrate they act on (e.g., sucrase, lactase).
    - **Classification:** Classified into 6 classes based on the type of reaction they catalyze:
        1. **Oxidoreductases:** Catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions.
        2. **Transferases:** Catalyze the transfer of a functional group from one molecule to another.
        3. **Hydrolases:** Catalyze the hydrolysis of a bond.
        4. **Lyases:** Catalyze the removal of a group from a substrate to form a double bond.
        5. **Isomerases:** Catalyze the interconversion of isomers.
        6. **Ligases:** Catalyze the joining of two molecules.
- **Co-factors:** Non-protein constituents bound to the enzyme to make it catalytically active.
    - **Prosthetic groups:** Tightly bound to the enzyme (e.g., heme in hemoglobin).
    - **Co-enzymes:** Loosely bound to the enzyme (e.g., NAD, FAD).
    - **Metal ions:** Act as a bridge between the enzyme and the substrate (e.g., Zn2+, Mg2+).
- **Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity:**
    - **Temperature:** Enzyme activity increases with temperature up to an optimum temperature, after which it denatures.
    - **pH:** Each enzyme has an optimum pH at which its activity is maximum.
    - **Substrate concentration:** The rate of reaction increases with substrate concentration until the enzyme is saturated with the substrate.
- **Competitive Inhibitors:**
    - A substance that competes with the substrate for the active site of the enzyme. It has a similar structure to the substrate.

## 5. Secondary Metabolites
