## Section C: Medium Answer Questions

1.  A tissue is a group of similar cells that work together to perform a specific function. Its importance in multicellular organisms lies in the division of labor, allowing for specialization and increased efficiency, which enables the organism to grow larger and more complex.
2.  Plant tissues are broadly classified into meristematic tissues (e.g., apical meristem) and permanent tissues. Permanent tissues are further divided into simple permanent tissues (e.g., parenchyma) and complex permanent tissues (e.g., xylem).
3.  Meristematic tissues consist of small, actively dividing cells with dense cytoplasm and thin walls, responsible for growth. Permanent tissues are composed of differentiated cells that have lost the ability to divide and have specialized functions such as storage, support, or transport.
4.  Meristematic tissues are characterized by small, isodiametric, actively dividing cells with large nuclei and thin walls. Their significance lies in their ability to produce new cells, leading to the growth and development of the plant.
5.  Apical meristem is located at the tips of roots and shoots. Its function is to produce new cells that lead to an increase in the length of the plant, a process known as primary growth.
6.  Lateral meristem, such as the cambium, is located along the sides of stems and roots. It is responsible for secondary growth, which is the increase in the girth or thickness of the plant.
7.  Intercalary meristem is found at the base of leaves and internodes. It is responsible for the growth in length of these parts, allowing for rapid growth in grasses and other monocots.
8.  Simple permanent tissues are composed of only one type of cell (e.g., parenchyma), while complex permanent tissues are composed of more than one type of cell working together (e.g., xylem and phloem).
9.  Parenchyma tissue consists of thin-walled, isodiametric cells with large vacuoles. Its functions include storage of food, photosynthesis (in chlorenchyma), and providing turgidity to the plant.
10. Chlorenchyma is a type of parenchyma tissue that contains chloroplasts. Its role in plants is to perform photosynthesis, the process of converting light energy into chemical energy.
11. Collenchyma tissue consists of elongated cells with unevenly thickened cell walls, especially at the corners. Its functions are to provide mechanical support and flexibility to young, growing parts of the plant.
12. Collenchyma provides mechanical support through its thickened cell walls, which are strong enough to provide support but flexible enough to allow for growth and movement.
13. Sclerenchyma tissue consists of long, narrow cells with thick, lignified cell walls. These cells are dead at maturity. Its function is to provide mechanical strength and rigidity to the plant.
14. Collenchyma consists of living cells with unevenly thickened, non-lignified walls, providing flexible support. Sclerenchyma consists of dead cells with thick, lignified walls, providing rigid support.
15. Sclerenchyma cells are dead at maturity because their thick, lignified walls are impermeable to water and nutrients, preventing the cell from carrying out metabolic functions.
16. Xylem is a complex tissue composed of several cell types. Its function is to transport water and minerals from the roots to the rest of the plant.
17. Phloem is a complex tissue composed of several cell types. Its function is to transport food (sugars) produced during photosynthesis from the leaves to other parts of the plant.
18. Xylem transports water and minerals from the roots upwards, while phloem transports food from the leaves to all parts of the plant where it is needed.
19. Vascular tissues (xylem and phloem) are important in plants as they form the transport system, allowing for the movement of water, minerals, and food, which is essential for the plant's survival and growth.
20. Different tissues contribute to plant support in various ways. Collenchyma provides flexible support to young stems, while sclerenchyma provides rigid support to mature parts of the plant. Xylem also contributes to support due to its lignified cell walls.
21. The structure of a cell is closely related to its function in a tissue. For example, the long, hollow shape of xylem vessels makes them efficient for water transport, while the thin walls of parenchyma cells allow for easy storage and exchange of substances.
22. The cell walls of different plant tissues vary in thickness and composition. Meristematic cells have thin walls for easy division. Parenchyma has thin walls for storage and photosynthesis. Collenchyma has unevenly thickened walls for flexible support. Sclerenchyma has thick, lignified walls for rigid support.
23. In a young stem, the outermost layer is the epidermis. Below the epidermis is the cortex, which may contain collenchyma for support and parenchyma for storage. The vascular bundles (xylem and phloem) are located in the center, surrounded by sclerenchyma for support. The pith, composed of parenchyma, is in the center.
24. Intercellular spaces, particularly in parenchyma tissue, allow for the circulation of gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, which are necessary for respiration and photosynthesis.
25. Lignification, the deposition of lignin in the cell wall, makes the cell wall rigid, waterproof, and resistant to decay. This provides mechanical strength and support to the plant.
26. Cell division, which occurs in meristematic tissues, is essential for plant growth as it is the process by which new cells are produced, leading to an increase in the size of the plant.
27. Tissue differentiation in plants is the process by which cells produced by meristems develop into specialized tissues with specific functions. This process is controlled by genetic and hormonal factors.
28. Primary growth is the increase in the length of the plant, which occurs at the apical meristems. Secondary growth is the increase in the girth of the plant, which occurs at the lateral meristems.
29. Meristematic activity, through cell division, produces new cells. These cells then elongate and differentiate, leading to the overall growth of the plant in both length and girth.
30. Different tissues are adapted to their functions through their structure. For example, the thick, lignified walls of sclerenchyma are an adaptation for providing support, while the presence of chloroplasts in chlorenchyma is an adaptation for photosynthesis.
31. The significance of tissue organization in plants is that it allows for the efficient functioning of the plant as a whole. Tissues are organized into systems (dermal, ground, and vascular) that work together to carry out essential life processes.
32. Living tissues, such as parenchyma and collenchyma, are metabolically active and perform functions such as storage, photosynthesis, and flexible support. Dead tissues, such as sclerenchyma and xylem vessels, provide rigid support and transport.
33. Vacuoles in plant tissues have several roles. In parenchyma, they store water, food, and waste products, and maintain turgor pressure. In meristematic cells, they are small as the cells are actively dividing.
34. Plants achieve both support and flexibility through the combination of different tissues. Collenchyma provides flexible support to young, growing parts, while sclerenchyma provides rigid support to mature parts.
35. Storage tissues, primarily parenchyma, are important in plants as they store food reserves (such as starch and sugars) that can be used for energy during periods of dormancy or when photosynthesis is not possible.
36. The different tissue systems in a plant are coordinated to ensure its proper functioning. For example, the vascular tissue system transports water and nutrients to the ground tissue system, where photosynthesis and storage occur.
37. Environmental factors such as light, water availability, and temperature can influence tissue development. For example, plants grown in windy conditions may develop more supporting tissue.
38. The evolutionary significance of tissue specialization is that it allowed for the development of larger and more complex plants that could colonize a wider range of habitats.
39. The metabolic activities of different tissues vary. Meristematic tissues have high metabolic activity due to cell division. Parenchyma has moderate activity related to storage and photosynthesis. Sclerenchyma has no metabolic activity as the cells are dead.
40. The nucleus in different tissue types reflects their function. In meristematic cells, the nucleus is large and active, controlling cell division. In mature parenchyma cells, the nucleus is smaller as the cell is less metabolically active. In sclerenchyma, the nucleus is absent.
41. Cell shape is related to tissue function. For example, the elongated shape of collenchyma and sclerenchyma cells is suited for providing support, while the isodiametric shape of parenchyma cells is efficient for storage.
42. Cell wall modifications, such as thickening and lignification, are important in tissues as they determine the physical properties of the tissue, such as its strength and flexibility.
43. Tissue complementarity in plants refers to the way in which different tissues work together to perform a function that none of them could perform alone. For example, xylem and phloem work together to transport substances throughout the plant.
44. Tissues are integrated to form organs such as leaves, stems, and roots. Each organ is composed of different tissues that work together to perform the specific functions of that organ.
45. Meristematic tissues play a crucial role in plant regeneration. When a plant is injured, meristematic cells can be activated to divide and differentiate to form new tissues and repair the damage.
46. Different plant tissues have economic importance. For example, wood (secondary xylem) is used for construction and paper production, while fibers (sclerenchyma) are used to make textiles.
47. Tissue structure reflects evolutionary adaptations. For example, the development of vascular tissues was a key adaptation that allowed plants to grow tall and colonize land.
48. Tissues play a role in plant defense mechanisms. For example, the epidermis provides a physical barrier against pathogens, and some tissues produce chemical compounds that deter herbivores.
49. Plant hormones play a crucial role in regulating tissue development and differentiation. For example, auxins promote cell elongation, while cytokinins promote cell division.
50. Understanding plant tissues helps in agriculture by providing knowledge about how to optimize plant growth and productivity. For example, understanding vascular tissues can help in developing better irrigation techniques.

## Section D: Broad Answer Questions

1.  Plant tissues are broadly classified into two main types: meristematic tissues and permanent tissues.
    *   **Meristematic tissues** are characterized by actively dividing cells and are responsible for plant growth. They have small, isodiametric cells with thin walls, dense cytoplasm, and large nuclei. They are located in the growing regions of the plant. Examples include apical meristem (at root and shoot tips), lateral meristem (cambium), and intercalary meristem (at the base of leaves).
    *   **Permanent tissues** are composed of cells that have lost the ability to divide and have specialized functions. They are classified into:
        *   **Simple permanent tissues**, which are made up of only one type of cell. Examples include:
            *   **Parenchyma:** Thin-walled, living cells with large vacuoles, involved in storage and photosynthesis.
            *   **Collenchyma:** Living cells with unevenly thickened walls, providing flexible support.
            *   **Sclerenchyma:** Dead cells with thick, lignified walls, providing rigid support.
        *   **Complex permanent tissues**, which are made up of more than one type of cell. Examples include:
            *   **Xylem:** Transports water and minerals from the roots to the rest of the plant.
            *   **Phloem:** Transports food from the leaves to other parts of the plant.

2.  Meristematic tissues are composed of small, actively dividing cells responsible for plant growth.
    *   **Structure:** The cells are isodiametric, with thin cell walls, dense cytoplasm, a large nucleus, and no intercellular spaces.
    *   **Location:** They are found in the growing regions of the plant, such as the tips of roots and shoots (apical meristem), the sides of stems and roots (lateral meristem), and the base of leaves and internodes (intercalary meristem).
    *   **Functions:** Their primary function is to produce new cells through cell division, which leads to the growth of the plant in length (primary growth) and girth (secondary growth). They are essential for the development of all plant organs and for the repair of injuries.

3.  Parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma are three types of simple permanent tissues.
    *   **Parenchyma:** Consists of living, thin-walled, isodiametric cells with large vacuoles. It is involved in storage, photosynthesis, and providing turgidity.
    *   **Collenchyma:** Consists of living, elongated cells with unevenly thickened, non-lignified cell walls. It provides flexible mechanical support to young, growing parts of the plant.
    *   **Sclerenchyma:** Consists of dead, long, narrow cells with thick, lignified cell walls. It provides rigid mechanical support to mature parts of the plant.
    *   **Comparison:** Parenchyma is the least specialized and most abundant. Collenchyma provides flexible support, while sclerenchyma provides rigid support. Parenchyma and collenchyma are living tissues, while sclerenchyma is a dead tissue.

4.  Complex permanent tissues are composed of more than one type of cell and are involved in transport.
    *   **Xylem:** This tissue is responsible for the transport of water and minerals from the roots to the rest of the plant. It is composed of several types of cells, including tracheids, vessels, xylem parenchyma, and xylem fibers. The tracheids and vessels are the main conducting cells and are dead at maturity.
    *   **Phloem:** This tissue is responsible for the transport of food (sugars) from the leaves to other parts of the plant. It is composed of sieve tubes, companion cells, phloem parenchyma, and phloem fibers. The sieve tubes are the main conducting cells and are living but lack a nucleus at maturity.
    *   **Importance:** These tissues are vital for the survival of the plant as they ensure that all parts of the plant receive the necessary water, minerals, and food.

5.  The structure of different plant tissues is adapted to their specific functions.
    *   **Xylem:** The long, hollow, and dead cells of xylem (vessels and tracheids) form continuous tubes that are ideal for the efficient transport of water.
    *   **Phloem:** The sieve tubes of phloem have pores in their end walls that allow for the easy flow of food.
    *   **Sclerenchyma:** The thick, lignified walls of sclerenchyma cells provide maximum strength and support.
    *   **Parenchyma:** The thin walls and large vacuoles of parenchyma cells are suited for storage and maintaining turgor pressure.
    *   **Collenchyma:** The unevenly thickened but flexible walls of collenchyma cells provide support without restricting growth.

6.  Meristematic tissues are crucial for plant growth and development.
    *   **Primary growth:** This is the increase in the length of the plant and is carried out by the apical meristems located at the tips of roots and shoots.
    *   **Secondary growth:** This is the increase in the girth or thickness of the plant and is carried out by the lateral meristems, such as the cambium, which produces new xylem and phloem.
    *   **Role in development:** Meristematic tissues are responsible for the formation of all new organs and tissues in the plant, and for the repair of wounds.

7.  Plants have several supporting tissues that provide mechanical support.
    *   **Collenchyma:** This tissue provides flexible support to young, growing parts of the plant, such as stems and leaves. Its cells have unevenly thickened walls that allow for both support and growth.
    *   **Sclerenchyma:** This tissue provides rigid support to mature parts of the plant. Its cells have thick, lignified walls that make them very strong.
    *   **Xylem:** In addition to its transport function, the lignified walls of xylem cells also contribute to the overall support of the plant.

8.  The transport system in plants consists of two conducting tissues: xylem and phloem.
    *   **Xylem:** This tissue forms a continuous network of tubes that transports water and dissolved minerals from the roots to the leaves. The movement of water in the xylem is primarily driven by transpiration (the evaporation of water from the leaves).
    *   **Phloem:** This tissue transports sugars produced during photosynthesis from the leaves to other parts of the plant where they are needed for growth or storage. The movement of food in the phloem is an active process that requires energy.

9.  Tissue specialization in plants is important because it allows for a division of labor among different cells and tissues. This leads to increased efficiency in carrying out essential life processes such as photosynthesis, transport, support, and reproduction. This specialization has enabled plants to become large, complex organisms that can survive in a wide range of environments.

10. Tissue differentiation in plants is the process by which cells produced by meristems develop specialized structures and functions. This process is controlled by a combination of genetic factors and environmental cues. Plant hormones, such as auxins, cytokinins, and gibberellins, play a key role in regulating which genes are expressed and thus what type of tissue a cell will become.

11. Different tissues work together to form a functional plant body. The dermal tissue system (epidermis) protects the plant. The ground tissue system (parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma) is involved in photosynthesis, storage, and support. The vascular tissue system (xylem and phloem) transports water, minerals, and food. These three tissue systems are integrated to form organs such as roots, stems, and leaves, which work together to ensure the survival of the plant.

12. There is a close relationship between cell structure, tissue organization, and plant function. The structure of a cell determines its function. Cells with similar functions are organized into tissues. Tissues are organized into tissue systems, and tissue systems are organized into organs. This hierarchical organization allows for the efficient functioning of the plant as a whole.

13. The evolutionary significance of tissue development in plants is immense. The development of specialized tissues, particularly vascular tissues, allowed plants to grow tall and compete for sunlight, and to colonize land. Tissue differentiation also led to the development of specialized reproductive structures, which increased the chances of successful reproduction.

14. Cell walls are a key feature of plant cells and their structure varies depending on the tissue type.
    *   **Meristematic cells:** Have thin, primary cell walls that allow for easy cell division.
    *   **Parenchyma cells:** Have thin, primary cell walls.
    *   **Collenchyma cells:** Have unevenly thickened, primary cell walls.
    *   **Sclerenchyma cells:** Have thick, secondary cell walls that are lignified.
    *   **Modifications:** The modifications of the cell wall, such as thickening and lignification, are crucial for the function of the tissue, providing support, protection, and regulating transport.

15. Plants balance the need for support and flexibility through the use of different tissue types. Collenchyma provides flexible support to young, growing parts of the plant, allowing them to bend without breaking. Sclerenchyma provides rigid support to mature parts of the plant, giving them strength and stability. The combination of these two tissue types allows the plant to be both strong and flexible.

16. Storage and photosynthetic tissues are essential for plant metabolism.
    *   **Photosynthetic tissues (chlorenchyma):** These tissues, located primarily in the leaves, are responsible for photosynthesis, the process that converts light energy into chemical energy in the form of sugars.
    *   **Storage tissues (parenchyma):** These tissues store the sugars produced during photosynthesis as starch, which can be used for energy when photosynthesis is not possible, such as at night or during winter.

17. The location of different tissues in plant organs is related to their functions.
    *   **Leaves:** The epidermis protects the leaf, the mesophyll (chlorenchyma) carries out photosynthesis, and the vascular bundles (xylem and phloem) transport water and food.
    *   **Stems:** The epidermis provides protection, the cortex provides support and storage, and the vascular bundles provide transport and support.
    *   **Roots:** The epidermis absorbs water and minerals, the cortex stores food, and the vascular cylinder transports water and minerals to the rest of the plant.

18. Intercellular spaces are the spaces between cells in a tissue. They are most prominent in parenchyma tissue. Their functional significance is primarily in facilitating gas exchange. They allow for the circulation of oxygen, which is needed for respiration, and carbon dioxide, which is needed for photosynthesis.

19. Understanding plant tissue structure helps in plant breeding and agriculture in several ways. It allows breeders to select for plants with desirable traits, such as strong stems or high-yielding leaves. It also helps in developing better agricultural practices, such as optimizing irrigation and fertilization to meet the needs of the different tissues.

20. Plant tissues show adaptations to environmental conditions. For example, plants in dry environments may have a thicker epidermis to reduce water loss, while plants in shady environments may have larger leaves with more chlorenchyma to maximize light absorption. Plants in windy environments may have more supporting tissue to prevent damage.

21. A tissue system is a group of tissues that work together to perform a specific function. In plants, there are three tissue systems:
    *   **Dermal tissue system:** This is the outer protective layer of the plant and consists of the epidermis.
    *   **Ground tissue system:** This system makes up the bulk of the plant and is involved in photosynthesis, storage, and support. It consists of parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma.
    *   **Vascular tissue system:** This system is responsible for transport and consists of xylem and phloem.

22. Both living and dead cells are important in different plant tissues.
    *   **Living cells:** Tissues such as parenchyma, collenchyma, and phloem are composed of living cells that are metabolically active and carry out functions such as photosynthesis, storage, and transport of food.
    *   **Dead cells:** Tissues such as sclerenchyma and xylem are composed of dead cells at maturity. Their primary function is to provide mechanical support and transport of water, which can be done effectively by hollow, rigid cells.

23. When a plant is injured, it can respond by activating meristematic tissues to heal the wound. Parenchyma cells near the wound can dedifferentiate and become meristematic, dividing to form a callus, which is a mass of undifferentiated cells. The callus can then differentiate to form new tissues and repair the damage.

24. The structure of plant tissues is related to their economic uses.
    *   **Wood (secondary xylem):** Its strength and durability make it useful for construction, furniture, and paper.
    *   **Fibers (sclerenchyma):** The long, strong fibers of plants like cotton and flax are used to make textiles.
    *   **Parenchyma:** The storage parenchyma of plants like potatoes and rice is a major source of food for humans.

25. The study of plant tissues, known as plant anatomy, is fundamental to our understanding of plant biology. It helps us to understand how plants grow, develop, and function. This knowledge is also essential for biotechnology, as it allows us to manipulate plant tissues in culture to produce new plants or valuable compounds.
