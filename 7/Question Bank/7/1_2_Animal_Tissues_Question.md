## Section D: Broad Answer Questions

1.  The four main types of animal tissues are:
    *   **Epithelial tissue:** Covers body surfaces and lines internal organs. Functions in protection, secretion, absorption, and filtration.
    *   **Connective tissue:** Found throughout the body. Functions in support, protection, transport, and connecting other tissues. Examples include bone, cartilage, blood, ligaments, and tendons.
    *   **Muscular tissue:** Composed of cells that can contract. Responsible for movement. Types include skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscle.
    *   **Nerve tissue:** Composed of neurons. Responsible for conducting electrical impulses and coordinating body functions.

2.  **Connective tissue** is characterized by cells scattered within an extracellular matrix. Its functions include support, protection, and transport.
    *   **Bone:** A hard matrix of collagen and minerals, providing support and protection.
    *   **Cartilage:** A flexible matrix, providing support and reducing friction.
    *   **Blood:** A liquid matrix (plasma), transporting substances.
    *   **Ligaments:** Dense, fibrous tissue connecting bones to bones.
    *   **Tendons:** Dense, fibrous tissue connecting muscles to bones.

3.  The three types of muscular tissues are:
    *   **Skeletal muscle:** Striated, voluntary, attached to bones. Responsible for body movements.
    *   **Smooth muscle:** Unstriated, involuntary, found in the walls of internal organs. Responsible for involuntary movements.
    *   **Cardiac muscle:** Striated, involuntary, found only in the heart. Responsible for pumping blood.

4.  A **neuron** consists of a cell body, dendrites, and an axon. It conducts nerve impulses as follows: dendrites receive a signal, which is integrated in the cell body. If the signal is strong enough, an electrical impulse (action potential) is generated and transmitted down the axon to the axon terminal, where it is passed on to another neuron or an effector cell.

5.  **Epithelial tissue** plays various roles in different body systems. In the skin, it provides protection. In the digestive system, it absorbs nutrients. In the respiratory system, it facilitates gas exchange. In the endocrine system, it forms glands that secrete hormones. In the urinary system, it filters waste products.

6.  **Connective tissues** are crucial for providing support and protection. Bone forms the skeleton, which supports the body and protects vital organs. Cartilage provides flexible support and cushioning. Ligaments and tendons provide support and stability to joints.

7.  Different types of muscles work together to facilitate body movements. Skeletal muscles, under voluntary control, contract to pull on bones and cause movement. Smooth muscles in blood vessels regulate blood flow to the muscles. Cardiac muscle pumps blood to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the muscles.

8.  **Nerve tissue**, composed of neurons, is the main component of the nervous system. It is responsible for receiving sensory input, integrating information, and generating motor output. This allows for coordination of all body functions and responses to the environment.

9.  **Epithelial tissue** consists of tightly packed cells that cover surfaces and line cavities. It functions in protection, secretion, and absorption. **Connective tissue** consists of cells scattered in a matrix and functions in support, connection, and transport.

10. The structure of muscle tissues is related to their function. The long, cylindrical cells of skeletal muscle are adapted for powerful contractions. The spindle-shaped cells of smooth muscle are suited for sustained, involuntary contractions. The branched cells of cardiac muscle allow for coordinated contraction of the heart.

11. In the skeletal system, **bone** provides the rigid framework. **Cartilage** cushions the joints, reducing friction. **Ligaments** connect the bones, providing stability. **Tendons** connect the muscles to the bones, allowing for movement.

12. **Tissue specialization** in multicellular organisms allows for a division of labor, where different tissues are adapted for specific functions. This increases the efficiency and complexity of the organism, enabling it to perform a wider range of activities and survive in more diverse environments.

13. **Blood** is a liquid connective tissue that plays a vital role in transport. It carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs, nutrients from the digestive system to the cells, waste products from the cells to the kidneys, and hormones from glands to their target organs.

14. **Voluntary muscle control** (skeletal muscle) is under conscious control and allows for deliberate movements. **Involuntary muscle control** (smooth and cardiac muscle) is not under conscious control and regulates essential bodily functions such as digestion and circulation. Both are important for survival.

15. The structure of neurons is adapted for impulse conduction. The long axon allows for rapid transmission of signals over long distances. The branched dendrites increase the surface area for receiving signals. The myelin sheath around some axons insulates them and speeds up signal transmission.

16. Animal tissues are classified into four main types based on their structure and function: epithelial, connective, muscular, and nervous. This classification helps in understanding the organization and functioning of the animal body.

17. Different tissues are organized into organs, and organs are organized into organ systems. The coordinated functioning of these tissues and organs is essential for the survival of the organism. For example, in the digestive system, epithelial tissue absorbs nutrients, smooth muscle moves food along, and nerve tissue controls the process.

18. **Smooth muscle** is found in the walls of many organ systems, including the digestive, respiratory, urinary, and circulatory systems. It is under involuntary control by the autonomic nervous system and is responsible for processes such as peristalsis, bronchoconstriction, and vasoconstriction.

19. **Epithelial tissue** contributes to homeostasis (maintaining a stable internal environment) by forming selective barriers that control the movement of substances into and out of the body and between different compartments of the body.

20. **Cardiac muscle** has several unique properties, including its ability to contract rhythmically without external stimulation (autorhythmicity) and its ability to function as a single, coordinated unit (syncytium). These properties are essential for its function of pumping blood continuously and effectively.

21. The relationship between tissue structure and function is a fundamental principle of biology. For example, the thin, flat cells of the lung epithelium are adapted for gas exchange, while the thick, strong fibers of tendons are adapted for transmitting force.

22. **Connective tissues** provide structural integrity to the body in several ways. Bone forms the rigid skeleton, cartilage provides flexible support, and fibrous connective tissues such as ligaments and tendons hold structures together.

23. Muscle contraction is caused by the sliding of actin and myosin filaments within muscle cells. In skeletal muscle, contraction is initiated by a nerve impulse. In smooth muscle, contraction can be initiated by nerves, hormones, or stretching. In cardiac muscle, contraction is initiated by specialized pacemaker cells.

24. **Nerve tissue** plays a central role in integrating body functions and responses. It receives information from the environment and from within the body, processes this information, and generates appropriate responses, coordinating the activities of all other tissues and organs.

25. The different animal tissues work together to maintain life processes. For example, the nervous system coordinates the muscular system to obtain food. The digestive system (lined with epithelial tissue and containing smooth muscle) breaks down the food. The circulatory system (blood, a connective tissue) transports the nutrients to all the cells of the body.
