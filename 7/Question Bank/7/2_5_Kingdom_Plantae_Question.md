20. Fertilized ovules form seeds, containing embryo and nutrients.
21. Ovaries develop into fruits, protecting and helping disperse seeds.
22. Sporophyte is diploid, makes spores; gametophyte is haploid, makes gametes.
23. Seed germinates → seedling → adult → flowers → pollination/fertilization → seeds/fruits form.
24. Bryophytes are small, moist-loving, non-vascular; e.g., mosses.
25. Pteridophytes have vascular tissue, reproduce by spores; e.g., ferns.
26. Gymnosperms have cones/naked seeds; angiosperms have flowers/covered seeds.
27. In double fertilization, one sperm fuses with egg, another with central cell for endosperm.
28. Endosperm nourishes embryo in angiosperm seeds.
29. Annuals: 1 year, biennials: 2 years, perennials: many years life cycle.
30. Desert plants store water, aquatic have floating leaves, shade plants have broad leaves.
31. Roots can store food (carrot), support (prop roots), or breathe (pneumatophores).
32. Stems may be thorns (protection), tubers (storage), or tendrils (climbing).
33. Leaves can be spines (defense), traps (nutrition), or scales (storage).
34. Plants grow towards/away from light (phototropism), gravity (geotropism), water (hydrotropism).

3. Photosynthesis: light reaction in grana produces ATP/O₂, dark reaction in stroma fixes CO₂ to glucose; critical for life.
4. Chloroplasts (photosynthesis, chlorophyll), cell wall (rigid, cellulose), vacuoles (storage/turgor); unlike animal cells, which lack these structures.
5. Xylem: water/minerals from roots to leaves; phloem: food from leaves to rest of plant; via transpiration and translocation.
6. Sexual reproduction (flowers/seeds, variation); asexual (runners, bulbs, clones); mosses/fungi—spores; angiosperms—seeds.
7. Life cycle: pollination → fertilization → seed/fruit → dispersal → germination → adult → reproduction; alternates generations.
