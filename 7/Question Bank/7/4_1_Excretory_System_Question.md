## SECTION C: SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS (2 MARKS EACH)

1.  Excretion is the vital process of removing metabolic wastes and excess substances from an organism's body. This is important because the accumulation of these wastes, such as urea and carbon dioxide, can be toxic and disrupt the body's internal balance, or homeostasis.
2.  The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs located on either side of the spine, just below the rib cage. Each kidney is enclosed in a fibrous capsule and consists of an outer cortex and an inner medulla.
3.  The urinary system consists of the kidneys, which filter blood and produce urine; the ureters, which carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder; the urinary bladder, which stores urine; and the urethra, which expels urine from the body.
4.  Kidneys filter blood through millions of nephrons. Blood enters the nephron, and in the glomerulus, water, waste products, and other small molecules are forced out of the blood into the Bowman's capsule. This filtrate then passes through the renal tubule, where essential substances are reabsorbed back into the blood, and more waste is secreted into the tubule, forming urine.
5.  The kidneys are the primary excretory organs, removing nitrogenous wastes like urea from the blood. The skin excretes excess water, salts, and a small amount of urea in sweat. The lungs excrete carbon dioxide, a gaseous waste product of respiration, and water vapor.
6.  Urine is formed in the nephrons within the kidneys. It then flows into the renal pelvis and is transported through the ureters to the urinary bladder for storage. When the bladder is full, urine is expelled from the body through the urethra.
7.  A nephron is the microscopic functional unit of the kidney. It consists of a renal corpuscle (glomerulus and Bowman's capsule) and a renal tubule. The renal corpuscle filters the blood, and the renal tubule processes the filtrate through reabsorption and secretion to form urine.
8.  The ureters are two narrow tubes that connect the kidneys to the urinary bladder. Their function is to transport urine from the renal pelvis of each kidney to the bladder using peristaltic contractions of their muscular walls.
9.  The urinary bladder is a hollow, muscular sac located in the pelvis. Its primary function is to store urine received from the ureters. The bladder's muscular wall, called the detrusor muscle, can stretch to accommodate increasing volumes of urine and contract to expel it.
10. The urethra is a tube that extends from the urinary bladder to the outside of the body. In both males and females, its function is to carry urine from the bladder out of the body during urination. In males, it also serves as a passageway for semen.
11. Blood entering the kidneys via the renal artery is rich in oxygen and contains metabolic wastes like urea. Blood leaving the kidneys via the renal vein is lower in oxygen, has significantly lower concentrations of urea and other wastes, and has a more balanced composition of water and salts.
12. Reabsorption is the process by which the kidneys return useful substances from the filtrate back to the blood. This occurs primarily in the renal tubules of the nephron. Substances like glucose, amino acids, vitamins, and most of the water and salts are reabsorbed.
13. Kidneys maintain water balance by regulating the volume of urine produced. When the body is dehydrated, the kidneys conserve water by producing concentrated urine. When there is excess water, they produce dilute urine. This process is primarily regulated by the antidiuretic hormone (ADH).
14. Kidneys maintain salt balance by controlling the amount of salts, such as sodium and potassium, reabsorbed from the filtrate back into the blood. This process is influenced by hormones like aldosterone, ensuring that the concentration of salts in the blood remains within a narrow, healthy range.
15. Sweat is produced by sweat glands in the skin and is composed mainly of water, with dissolved salts (like sodium chloride) and a small amount of urea. Its primary function is to cool the body through evaporation, but it also serves as a minor excretory pathway.
16. The lungs are considered excretory organs because they remove carbon dioxide, a major metabolic waste product of cellular respiration, from the body. During exhalation, carbon dioxide and water vapor are expelled from the body.
17. Humans primarily excrete urea, which is less toxic than ammonia and requires less water to excrete. Birds and reptiles excrete uric acid, which is a solid and requires very little water. Aquatic animals often excrete ammonia directly into the water.
18. A Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is an infection in any part of the urinary system, most commonly the bladder and urethra. It is usually caused by bacteria, such as E. coli, entering the urinary tract. Symptoms include a frequent urge to urinate, a burning sensation during urination, and cloudy or strong-smelling urine.
19. Kidney stones are hard deposits of minerals and salts that form inside the kidneys. They can be caused by a variety of factors, including dehydration, diet, and certain medical conditions. The most common types are calcium oxalate stones, but they can also be composed of uric acid, struvite, or cystine.
20. Prevention methods for kidney stones include staying well-hydrated by drinking plenty of water, eating a balanced diet that is not excessively high in salt, animal protein, or oxalate-rich foods, and maintaining a healthy weight.
21. Acute kidney disease (or acute kidney injury) is a sudden loss of kidney function that occurs over a few hours or days. Chronic kidney disease is a gradual loss of kidney function over a period of months or years.
22. Kidney failure, or end-stage renal disease (ESRD), is the complete or near-complete loss of kidney function. It can be acute (sudden) or chronic (gradual). When the kidneys fail, they can no longer filter waste from the blood, leading to a buildup of toxins.
23. Dialysis is a medical procedure that artificially filters waste products from the blood when the kidneys are unable to do so. In hemodialysis, blood is pumped out of the body to an artificial kidney machine and returned. In peritoneal dialysis, a special fluid is put into the abdomen to absorb waste from the blood.
24. Kidney transplantation is a surgical procedure to place a healthy kidney from a living or deceased donor into a person whose kidneys no longer function. Criteria for transplantation include having end-stage renal disease and being healthy enough for surgery. The process involves matching the donor and recipient's blood and tissue types.
25. An artificial kidney, or dialyzer, is the machine used in hemodialysis. It works by passing the patient's blood through a series of semi-permeable membranes that are surrounded by a special fluid called dialysate. Waste products from the blood diffuse into the dialysate, and the cleaned blood is returned to the body.
26. Normal urine is typically clear and pale yellow to amber in color. It has a mild odor and is slightly acidic. It should not contain significant amounts of glucose, protein, blood cells, or bacteria.
27. Abnormal constituents in urine can include glucose (indicating diabetes), protein (indicating kidney damage), red blood cells (indicating bleeding in the urinary tract), white blood cells (indicating infection), and bacteria.
28. Urine analysis is a crucial diagnostic tool. It can help detect a wide range of disorders, including urinary tract infections, kidney disease, and diabetes. The presence of abnormal constituents or changes in the normal characteristics of urine can provide important clues about a person's health.
29. Urination, or micturition, is controlled by both involuntary and voluntary mechanisms. The bladder filling and the initial urge to urinate are involuntary reflexes. However, the conscious decision to urinate is a voluntary control exerted by the brain over the external urethral sphincter.
30. Bladder control in children develops as their nervous system matures. Initially, urination is a purely involuntary reflex. As children grow, they develop the ability to recognize the sensation of a full bladder and to voluntarily control the external urethral sphincter, typically between the ages of 2 and 3.
31. Kidney function is regulated by several hormones. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) controls water reabsorption. Aldosterone regulates sodium and potassium balance. Parathyroid hormone regulates calcium and phosphate levels.
32. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), released by the pituitary gland, plays a crucial role in water regulation. When the body is dehydrated, ADH is released, causing the kidneys to reabsorb more water and produce concentrated urine. When the body is well-hydrated, ADH levels decrease, and the kidneys produce dilute urine.
33. Blood pressure and kidney function are closely related. The kidneys help regulate blood pressure by controlling blood volume and producing hormones that affect blood vessel constriction. Conversely, high blood pressure can damage the blood vessels in the kidneys, impairing their function.
34. The kidneys receive a rich blood supply from the renal arteries, which branch directly from the aorta. After being filtered, the blood exits the kidneys through the renal veins, which drain into the inferior vena cava.
35. The kidneys are innervated by the autonomic nervous system. Sympathetic nerves can reduce blood flow to the kidneys and decrease urine production, while parasympathetic nerves have a less significant role.
36. The renal cortex is the outer region of the kidney and contains the glomeruli and convoluted tubules. The renal medulla is the inner region and contains the loops of Henle and collecting ducts. The cortex is primarily involved in filtration, while the medulla is crucial for concentrating urine.
37. The renal corpuscle is the initial filtering component of the nephron. It consists of the glomerulus, a tangled network of capillaries, and the Bowman's capsule, a cup-shaped structure that surrounds the glomerulus and collects the filtrate.
38. Glomerular filtration is the first step in urine formation. It is the process by which water and small solutes are forced out of the blood in the glomerulus and into the Bowman's capsule, forming a fluid called glomerular filtrate.
39. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is affected by blood pressure and blood flow to the kidneys. Higher blood pressure generally increases GFR, while lower blood pressure decreases it. Hormones and nerve signals can also influence GFR by constricting or dilating the arterioles leading to and from the glomerulus.
40. The renal tubules are the part of the nephron that extends from the Bowman's capsule. They are responsible for reabsorbing useful substances from the filtrate and secreting additional waste products into it. The main sections are the proximal convoluted tubule, the loop of Henle, and the distal convoluted tubule.
41. Tubular reabsorption is the process by which the renal tubules return most of the water and solutes from the filtrate back into the blood. This is a highly selective process that ensures essential substances are not lost in the urine.
42. Tubular secretion is the process by which the renal tubules actively transport waste products, such as hydrogen ions and certain drugs, from the blood into the filtrate. This process helps to eliminate substances that were not filtered by the glomerulus.
43. The countercurrent mechanism is a system in the kidneys that uses the flow of fluid in opposite directions in the loop of Henle and the vasa recta to create a concentration gradient in the medulla. This gradient allows the kidneys to produce concentrated urine.
44. Concentrated urine is formed when the body needs to conserve water. Under the influence of ADH, the collecting ducts become more permeable to water, allowing water to move from the filtrate into the highly concentrated interstitial fluid of the medulla, thus concentrating the urine.
45. The loop of Henle plays a critical role in urine concentration by creating a salt gradient in the medulla. The descending limb is permeable to water, while the ascending limb actively transports salt out of the filtrate. This creates the hypertonic environment necessary for concentrating urine.
46. The collecting duct system is the final part of the nephron. It receives filtrate from multiple nephrons and carries it through the medulla to the renal pelvis. The collecting ducts are where the final adjustments to the water content of the urine are made under the influence of ADH.
47. The micturition reflex is the involuntary reflex that causes the bladder to contract and the internal urethral sphincter to relax when the bladder is full. This reflex is controlled by the spinal cord, but it can be voluntarily overridden by the brain, which controls the external urethral sphincter.
48. With age, the number of nephrons in the kidneys decreases, and the glomerular filtration rate declines. This can make older adults more susceptible to kidney damage and less able to concentrate urine and excrete drugs effectively.
49. Dehydration reduces blood volume and blood pressure, which can decrease the glomerular filtration rate. In response, the body releases ADH, causing the kidneys to conserve water by producing a small volume of highly concentrated urine.
50. A high salt intake increases the concentration of sodium in the blood. The kidneys respond by excreting more sodium and water in the urine to restore the normal salt balance. Chronic high salt intake can contribute to high blood pressure and kidney disease.

## SECTION D: LONG ANSWER QUESTIONS (3 MARKS EACH)

1.  The human excretory system is composed of the kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra. The two bean-shaped kidneys filter metabolic wastes from the blood to form urine. This urine is then transported from each kidney through a tube called the ureter to the urinary bladder, a muscular sac that stores urine. Finally, urine is expelled from the body through the urethra. This entire system works to remove harmful substances and maintain water and electrolyte balance.
2.  Urine formation in the kidneys involves three main steps: glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption, and tubular secretion. First, in filtration, blood pressure forces water and small solutes from the blood in the glomerulus into the Bowman's capsule. Next, in reabsorption, essential substances like glucose, water, and salts are returned to the blood from the filtrate as it passes through the renal tubules. Finally, in secretion, additional waste products and excess ions are actively transported from the blood into the tubules, forming the final product, urine.
3.  The kidneys, lungs, and skin are all excretory organs, but they remove different waste products. The kidneys are the primary excretory organs, filtering the blood to remove nitrogenous wastes like urea, as well as excess salts and water, in the form of urine. The lungs excrete the gaseous waste product of respiration, carbon dioxide, along with water vapor. The skin excretes excess water, salts, and a small amount of urea through sweat. Multiple organs are needed to efficiently remove the different types of waste products generated by the body's metabolic processes.
4.  A nephron is the microscopic functional unit of the kidney, responsible for urine formation. It consists of a renal corpuscle and a renal tubule. The renal corpuscle, containing the glomerulus and Bowman's capsule, filters the blood. The renal tubule, which includes the proximal convoluted tubule, the loop of Henle, and the distal convoluted tubule, processes the filtrate. Through reabsorption and secretion, the tubule reclaims essential substances and adds more waste, playing a crucial role in maintaining the body's fluid and electrolyte balance.
5.  Common disorders of the urinary system include Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) and kidney stones. UTIs are typically bacterial infections that cause painful urination and can be treated with antibiotics. Kidney stones are hard mineral and salt deposits that form in the kidneys, causing severe pain as they pass through the urinary tract. Treatment for kidney stones ranges from increased fluid intake to medical procedures to break them up or remove them.
6.  Homeostasis is the maintenance of a stable internal environment in the body. The excretory system plays a vital role in homeostasis by regulating the composition of the blood. The kidneys, in particular, maintain water balance by adjusting the volume of urine produced. They also regulate the levels of essential salts and ions in the blood, ensuring that the body's cells function in a stable and optimal environment.
7.  Kidney stones are hard deposits of minerals and salts that form in the kidneys, often due to dehydration or diet. The most common type is calcium oxalate stones. Risk factors include a family history of kidney stones, dehydration, and certain diets. Symptoms can include severe pain in the back and side, blood in the urine, and nausea. Prevention involves staying hydrated and making dietary changes. Treatment depends on the size of the stone and can range from pain medication and increased fluid intake to procedures like lithotripsy to break up the stone.
8.  Dialysis is a life-saving treatment for kidney failure that artificially filters waste from the blood. In hemodialysis, blood is circulated through a machine with an artificial kidney (dialyzer) to remove waste before being returned to the body. This is usually done at a clinic a few times a week. Peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum) as a natural filter, with a special fluid introduced into the abdomen to absorb waste. Peritoneal dialysis can often be done at home.
9.  Kidney transplantation is a surgical procedure to replace a failed kidney with a healthy one from a donor. It is a treatment option for end-stage renal disease. Donors can be deceased or living, and they must be a good match in terms of blood and tissue type to reduce the risk of rejection. After the transplant, the recipient must take immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their life to prevent their body from rejecting the new kidney.
10. The kidneys are regulated by several hormones to maintain water and electrolyte balance. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the pituitary gland increases water reabsorption, concentrating the urine when the body is dehydrated. Aldosterone, from the adrenal glands, promotes the reabsorption of sodium and the excretion of potassium. These and other hormones work together to finely tune kidney function to the body's needs.
11. Urine analysis is a valuable diagnostic tool because the composition of urine reflects the overall health of the body. Normal urine contains water, urea, and salts. The presence of abnormal constituents like glucose can indicate diabetes, while protein can signal kidney damage. The presence of blood cells or bacteria can indicate infection or other problems in the urinary tract.
12. The excretory system undergoes changes throughout life. In infants, the kidneys are not fully mature, and bladder control is not developed. Bladder control is a developmental milestone usually achieved in early childhood as the nervous system matures. With aging, kidney function gradually declines, which can affect the body's ability to handle fluids, electrolytes, and medications.
13. The cardiovascular and excretory systems are intricately linked. The kidneys filter the entire blood volume many times a day, so they are highly dependent on adequate blood flow and pressure from the cardiovascular system. In turn, the kidneys regulate blood volume and produce hormones that affect blood pressure, so kidney health is essential for cardiovascular health.
14. The kidneys have remarkable adaptive mechanisms. During dehydration, they conserve water by producing a small amount of highly concentrated urine under the influence of ADH. During overhydration, they excrete a large volume of dilute urine to get rid of excess water. These responses are crucial for maintaining the body's fluid balance under varying conditions.
15. The excretory system, particularly the kidneys, plays a key role in maintaining the body's acid-base balance. They do this by excreting hydrogen ions (H+) into the urine and reabsorbing bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) back into the blood. This helps to keep the blood pH within a very narrow and tightly controlled range, which is essential for the proper functioning of enzymes and other physiological processes.
16. Excretory systems vary among different animals, adapted to their environments. Aquatic animals often excrete toxic ammonia directly into the water. Terrestrial animals need to conserve water, so they convert ammonia into less toxic forms like urea (in mammals) or uric acid (in birds and reptiles), which require less water for excretion.
17. An artificial kidney, or dialyzer, is a machine that mimics the filtering function of a real kidney. It works by passing a patient's blood on one side of a semi-permeable membrane while a special fluid, dialysate, flows on the other side. Waste products from the blood diffuse across the membrane into the dialysate, and the cleaned blood is returned to the patient. Technological advances are focused on creating more efficient and portable dialysis devices.
18. Lifestyle factors have a significant impact on kidney health. A healthy diet low in sodium and processed foods, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight can protect the kidneys. Conversely, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and a poor diet can contribute to high blood pressure and diabetes, which are leading causes of kidney disease.
19. Emergency conditions related to the excretory system include acute kidney injury (AKI), a sudden loss of kidney function, and urinary retention, the inability to empty the bladder. AKI requires immediate medical attention to identify and treat the underlying cause. Urinary retention can be painful and dangerous and often requires catheterization to drain the bladder.
20. Some kidney diseases have a genetic basis. Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is an inherited disorder where clusters of cysts develop within the kidneys, causing them to enlarge and lose function over time. Other genetic conditions can also affect the structure and function of the kidneys, highlighting the importance of family history in assessing kidney disease risk.
21. The kidneys are responsible for metabolizing and excreting many drugs from the body. In patients with kidney disease, this ability is impaired, which can lead to the accumulation of drugs to toxic levels. Therefore, doctors must often adjust the dosage of medications for patients with kidney disease to prevent adverse effects.
22. Exposure to environmental toxins and occupational hazards can damage the kidneys. Heavy metals like lead and mercury, as well as certain solvents and pesticides, are known to be nephrotoxic (toxic to the kidneys). People who work in industries where they are exposed to these substances are at an increased risk of developing kidney problems.
23. Children can experience a range of excretory system disorders, from common UTIs to more complex congenital abnormalities of the kidneys and urinary tract. Management of these conditions in children requires specialized pediatric care, as their bodies are still growing and developing. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent long-term kidney damage.
24. Geriatric patients often experience a natural decline in kidney function with age. This can make them more vulnerable to kidney damage from medications, dehydration, and other illnesses. It is important for healthcare providers to consider these age-related changes when managing the health of older adults, particularly when prescribing medications that are cleared by the kidneys.
25. Recent advances in the treatment of kidney diseases offer hope for new therapies. Gene therapy is being explored as a way to correct genetic defects that cause kidney disease. Stem cell therapy is being investigated for its potential to regenerate damaged kidney tissue. These and other emerging modalities may one day provide alternatives to dialysis and transplantation.
