## SECTION C: SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS (2 Marks)

1. Respiration is called a biochemical process because it involves a series of chemical reactions that occur inside the living cells of an organism. These reactions break down organic molecules like glucose to produce energy for life functions.

2. Aerobic respiration releases a large amount of energy (around 38 ATP from one glucose molecule) because glucose is completely broken down. Anaerobic respiration releases a much smaller amount of energy (only 2 ATP) because the breakdown of glucose is incomplete.

3. Aerobic respiration requires a continuous supply of oxygen and the presence of glucose. It also needs specific enzymes and occurs within the mitochondria of the cell to proceed efficiently.

4. During alcoholic fermentation, which occurs in the absence of oxygen, yeast breaks down glucose into ethanol and carbon dioxide. This process releases a small amount of energy, which the yeast uses to survive.

5. In waterlogged soil, the air spaces are filled with water, depriving the roots of oxygen. To survive, the root cells switch to anaerobic respiration, breaking down glucose without oxygen to produce a small amount of ATP.

6. The reactants of photosynthesis are carbon dioxide and water, which are low-energy molecules. The reactants of respiration are glucose and oxygen, which are high-energy molecules.

7. ATP is called the energy currency because it is the principal molecule for storing and transferring energy in cells. Just as currency is used for economic transactions, ATP is used for energy-requiring processes in the cell, "paying" for cellular work.

8. During respiration, an organism takes in oxygen from the environment and releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. This gas exchange occurs in all living cells as they break down glucose for energy.

9. Photosynthesis only occurs during the daytime when light is available. In contrast, respiration is a continuous process that happens 24/7, both day and night, as living cells constantly require energy.

10. Photosynthesis is an anabolic process because it builds up complex organic molecules (glucose) from simpler inorganic ones (CO₂ and water). This process requires an input of energy (light) to create chemical bonds.

11. Respiration is a catabolic process because it breaks down complex organic molecules (glucose) into simpler ones (CO₂ and water). This breakdown releases the chemical energy stored in the glucose bonds.

12. Photosynthesis and respiration are complementary because the products of one process are the reactants for the other. Photosynthesis produces glucose and oxygen, which are then used in respiration. Respiration produces carbon dioxide and water, which are used in photosynthesis.

13. In photosynthesis, light energy is converted into chemical energy and stored in the bonds of glucose. In respiration, the chemical energy stored in glucose is released and converted into a usable form of chemical energy, ATP.

14. During aerobic respiration, glucose is completely broken down in the presence of oxygen. This multi-step process occurs mainly in the mitochondria and results in the production of carbon dioxide, water, and a large amount of ATP.

15. Anaerobic respiration produces less energy because the breakdown of glucose is incomplete. Without oxygen to act as the final electron acceptor, the process cannot extract all the energy stored in the glucose molecule, leaving much of it in the waste products like ethanol or lactic acid.

16. The products of aerobic respiration are carbon dioxide, water, and a large amount of ATP. The products of anaerobic respiration (in yeast) are ethanol, carbon dioxide, and a small amount of ATP.

17. Oxygen is crucial for aerobic respiration as it acts as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain. This role allows for the complete breakdown of glucose and the maximum release of energy in the form of ATP.

18. Respiration occurs continuously because all living cells require a constant supply of energy to perform their vital functions, such as maintenance, repair, growth, and movement. ATP, the product of respiration, is constantly being used and must be replenished.

19. Photosynthesis occurs only in cells containing chlorophyll, primarily in the chloroplasts of plant leaves. Respiration occurs in the cytoplasm and mitochondria of every living cell in an organism, including plants, animals, and microbes.

20. Respiration is vital for living organisms because it provides the energy necessary for all life processes. This energy, in the form of ATP, powers everything from muscle contraction and nerve impulses to growth and reproduction.

21. Yeast performs fermentation in an anaerobic environment (without oxygen). It breaks down sugars like glucose into ethanol and carbon dioxide, releasing a small amount of energy (ATP) for its own survival. This process is utilized in baking and brewing.

22. Complete breakdown of glucose, as seen in aerobic respiration, oxidizes the glucose molecule entirely to CO₂ and H₂O, releasing a large amount of energy. Incomplete breakdown, as in anaerobic respiration, only partially breaks down glucose, yielding less energy and producing organic byproducts like ethanol.

23. Anaerobic respiration is favored in conditions where oxygen is scarce or absent. This includes environments like waterlogged soils, the deep tissues of animals during strenuous exercise, or in microorganisms like yeast used in industrial fermentation.

24. Plants need photosynthesis to create their own food (glucose) by capturing light energy. They need respiration to break down that glucose to release the stored chemical energy in a usable form (ATP) to power their cellular activities, growth, and metabolism.

25. In photosynthesis, the gas exchange involves taking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. In respiration, the exchange is the opposite: taking in oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide.

26. Chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis as it captures light energy, but it plays no role in respiration. Respiration is a separate process that occurs in the mitochondria and cytoplasm, independent of chlorophyll.

27. The exothermic nature of respiration means it releases energy. This released energy is not all lost as heat; a significant portion is efficiently captured in the chemical bonds of ATP, which then powers cellular work.

28. Photosynthesis is an energy-storing process that requires an input of light energy. Respiration is an energy-releasing process that breaks down stored chemical energy.

29. Aerobic respiration is more efficient because the complete oxidation of glucose to CO₂ and water releases the maximum possible energy from the molecule. The use of oxygen as a final electron acceptor is key to this high energy yield.

30. Respiration is a general term for the metabolic processes that produce ATP. Fermentation is a specific type of anaerobic respiration that does not use an electron transport chain, resulting in a much lower energy yield and producing characteristic byproducts like ethanol or lactic acid.

31. The primary substrate for respiration is glucose, a high-energy organic molecule. The substrates for photosynthesis are carbon dioxide and water, which are low-energy inorganic molecules.

32. Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells. Respiration begins in the cytoplasm and is completed in the mitochondria of all eukaryotic cells.

33. Both processes are essential for plant survival because they are interlinked. Photosynthesis provides the fuel (glucose), and respiration burns that fuel to provide the energy (ATP) needed for the plant to live, grow, and reproduce.

34. Photosynthesis requires light, moderate temperatures, and sufficient CO₂ and water. Respiration occurs under a wider range of conditions but is also affected by temperature; it does not require light.

35. In plants, glucose is produced during the day via photosynthesis. This glucose is then consumed continuously by respiration to provide a steady supply of energy for the plant's metabolic needs, both day and night.

36. Respiration breaks the chemical bonds in glucose in a controlled, step-by-step process. The energy released from these bonds is captured and stored in the high-energy phosphate bonds of ATP molecules, which can then be easily used by the cell.

37. Photosynthesis consumes CO₂ and releases oxygen. Respiration consumes oxygen and releases CO₂.

38. Photosynthesis consumes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to build glucose. Respiration releases carbon dioxide as a waste product from the breakdown of glucose.

39. Respiration is an exothermic process, meaning it releases heat. This heat helps warm-blooded animals maintain a constant internal body temperature, which is essential for optimal enzyme function.

40. Aerobic pathways are more complex, involving glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain to maximize energy extraction. Anaerobic pathways are simpler, consisting mainly of glycolysis followed by fermentation steps to regenerate NAD+.

41. Plants balance energy by regulating the rates of photosynthesis and respiration. During the day, photosynthesis rates are high, producing more glucose than is immediately needed for respiration, allowing for storage. At night, the plant relies on these stored reserves for energy through respiration.

42. The ATP produced during respiration provides the energy for all aspects of plant growth and development. This includes cell division, nutrient uptake from the soil, and the synthesis of proteins and other essential molecules.

43. Aerobic respiration is highly efficient, capturing about 38-40% of the energy from glucose in ATP. Photosynthesis is less efficient in terms of overall energy capture from sunlight, but it is the ultimate source of energy for most ecosystems.

44. Continuous ATP production is crucial because cells do not store large amounts of ATP. It is constantly being used to power cellular activities, so it must be continuously generated through respiration to meet the cell's immediate energy demands.

45. Waterlogged conditions starve plant roots of oxygen, forcing them into inefficient anaerobic respiration. This leads to a severe energy deficit and a buildup of toxic ethanol, which can damage root cells and eventually kill the plant.

46. The evolution of aerobic respiration was a major turning point in the history of life. The high energy yield allowed for the development of complex, multicellular organisms with specialized tissues and active lifestyles, which would not be possible with the low energy output of anaerobic processes.

47. Breathing (or gas exchange) is the physical process of bringing oxygen into the body and expelling carbon dioxide. Cellular respiration is the biochemical process that occurs inside cells to use that oxygen to break down glucose and produce ATP.

48. Some simple organisms, like certain bacteria and yeasts, can survive without oxygen because they have metabolic pathways for anaerobic respiration or fermentation. This allows them to generate enough ATP to meet their lower energy demands in anaerobic environments.

49. Anaerobic processes are used industrially for brewing (ethanol fermentation) and making yogurt and cheese (lactic acid fermentation). Aerobic processes are fundamental to wastewater treatment, where microbes are used to break down organic waste.

50. Environmental factors like temperature, and the availability of oxygen and glucose, significantly affect the rate of respiration. Generally, the rate increases with temperature to an optimum, and the presence of oxygen allows for the much more efficient aerobic pathway.

## SECTION D: LONG ANSWER QUESTIONS (3 Marks)

1. Respiration is a fundamental biochemical process where living organisms break down organic substances, primarily glucose, to release energy. This energy is captured in the form of ATP and is essential for all life activities like growth, movement, and maintaining body temperature. The overall word equation is: **Glucose + Oxygen → Carbon Dioxide + Water + Energy**. It is called an exothermic process because it releases energy into the surroundings, partly as heat and partly as usable chemical energy in ATP.

2. Aerobic and anaerobic respiration are two types of cellular respiration. Aerobic respiration requires oxygen, completely breaks down glucose, and yields a large amount of energy (approx. 38 ATP). Its equation is **Glucose + Oxygen → CO₂ + H₂O + Energy**. It is performed by most plants and animals. In contrast, anaerobic respiration occurs without oxygen, incompletely breaks down glucose, and yields very little energy (2 ATP). In yeast, the equation is **Glucose → Ethanol + CO₂ + Energy**. It is performed by organisms like yeast and some bacteria, and in animal muscle cells during intense exercise.

3. Photosynthesis and respiration are complementary processes vital for plant life. Photosynthesis uses light energy, CO₂, and water to build glucose and release oxygen. Respiration uses that glucose and oxygen to release chemical energy (ATP), CO₂, and water. They are a perfect cycle: the products of photosynthesis are the reactants for respiration, and vice-versa. Both are essential because photosynthesis provides the food/fuel for the plant, while respiration unlocks the energy from that fuel, allowing the plant to power its growth and metabolism day and night.

4. Alcoholic fermentation is a type of anaerobic respiration carried out by organisms like yeast in the absence of oxygen. During this process, glucose is broken down into ethanol and carbon dioxide, releasing a small amount of energy (2 ATP). The word equation is **Glucose → Ethanol + Carbon Dioxide + Energy**. This process is commercially important; the carbon dioxide produced makes bread rise, and the ethanol produced is the basis for alcoholic beverages like beer and wine.

5. Photosynthesis and respiration differ in several key ways.
    *   **Nature:** Photosynthesis is an anabolic (building up) process, while respiration is a catabolic (breaking down) process.
    *   **Energy:** Photosynthesis stores light energy as chemical energy, whereas respiration releases stored chemical energy.
    *   **Reactants/Products:** Photosynthesis uses CO₂ and water to produce glucose and oxygen. Respiration uses glucose and oxygen to produce CO₂, water, and energy.
    *   **Occurrence:** Photosynthesis occurs only in cells with chlorophyll during the day. Respiration occurs in all living cells continuously, day and night.

6. When soil becomes waterlogged, the air spaces are filled with water, cutting off the oxygen supply to the plant roots. To survive, the root cells are forced to switch from efficient aerobic respiration to inefficient anaerobic respiration. This has severe consequences: the energy production drops dramatically, hindering nutrient uptake and root growth. Furthermore, the byproduct, ethanol, is toxic to the plant cells and its accumulation can lead to root death and ultimately the death of the plant.

7. ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) is the universal energy currency of the cell. It is a small molecule that stores and transports chemical energy. During respiration, the energy released from the breakdown of glucose is used to add a phosphate group to ADP (Adenosine Diphosphate), forming ATP. This process "charges" the molecule. When the cell needs energy for any process, like muscle contraction or active transport, it breaks a phosphate bond in ATP, releasing the stored energy and converting it back to ADP.

8. Photosynthesis and respiration are central to energy transformation on Earth. In photosynthesis, plants capture light energy from the sun and convert it into chemical energy, storing it in the bonds of glucose molecules. This is the primary way energy enters most ecosystems. Respiration then performs the reverse transformation, releasing the chemical energy stored in glucose and converting it into a form usable by the cell (ATP) to power all life functions. This flow of energy from the sun to producers and then to consumers is fundamental to life.

9. Aerobic respiration is vastly more efficient than anaerobic respiration. It can generate up to 38 ATP molecules from a single glucose molecule, while anaerobic respiration only produces 2 ATP. This is because the complete oxidation of glucose in the presence of oxygen releases its full energy potential. Organisms use anaerobic respiration only as a survival mechanism when oxygen is not available, as it provides a small but immediate supply of ATP, which is better than none at all.

10. The gas exchange processes in photosynthesis and respiration are opposite and complementary, creating a balance in the atmosphere. During photosynthesis, plants consume large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen as a byproduct. During respiration, all organisms (including plants) consume oxygen and release carbon dioxide. This reciprocal exchange helps to maintain the relatively stable levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that are essential for life.

11. Respiration is called a catabolic process because it involves the breakdown (catabolism) of large, complex molecules (glucose) into smaller, simpler ones (CO₂ and H₂O), releasing energy in the process. Conversely, photosynthesis is an anabolic process because it involves building (anabolism) large, complex molecules (glucose) from small, simple ones (CO₂ and H₂O), which requires an input of energy. These opposing processes of building up and breaking down are central to a plant's metabolism, allowing it to create and utilize energy reserves.

12. Respiration is a continuous process because organisms need a constant supply of energy to stay alive, regardless of the time of day. In contrast, photosynthesis is intermittent, as it is entirely dependent on the availability of light. To manage their energy needs, plants produce an excess of glucose during the day through photosynthesis and store it as starch. At night, or during periods of low light, they break down these stored reserves through respiration to ensure a continuous energy supply.

13. The breakdown of glucose yields vastly different outcomes depending on the presence of oxygen. In aerobic conditions, glucose is completely oxidized to carbon dioxide and water, releasing a large amount of energy (up to 38 ATP). In anaerobic conditions, glucose is only partially broken down. In yeast, the products are ethanol and carbon dioxide, while in animal muscles, it is lactic acid. In both anaerobic cases, the energy released is very small (only 2 ATP) because most of the chemical energy remains locked in the organic byproducts.

14. Respiration is crucial as it provides the energy for all fundamental life processes. The ATP generated powers growth through cell division and synthesis of new materials. It enables movement, from muscle contractions in animals to internal movements within cells. Energy from respiration is also required for reproduction and for maintaining a stable internal environment, such as regulating body temperature in warm-blooded animals. Without a constant supply of energy from respiration, life would cease.

15. The type of respiration performed is primarily determined by the availability of oxygen. In oxygen-rich environments, most organisms will perform aerobic respiration due to its high efficiency. However, if oxygen becomes scarce, some organisms can switch to anaerobic respiration. For example, human muscle cells switch to lactic acid fermentation during intense exercise when oxygen delivery is insufficient. Similarly, yeast switches to alcoholic fermentation in anaerobic conditions, a process harnessed in baking and brewing. The consequence of this switch is a drastic reduction in energy production.

16. The evolution of aerobic respiration was a pivotal event in the history of life on Earth. Early life forms were anaerobic, limited by the small energy yield of their metabolism. Once photosynthesis evolved and oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere, organisms that developed the machinery for aerobic respiration gained a massive advantage. The huge increase in energy efficiency allowed for the evolution of larger, more complex, multicellular organisms with specialized tissues and active lifestyles, shaping the biodiversity we see today.

17. Photosynthesis and respiration are the two key processes that drive the oxygen-carbon dioxide cycle. Photosynthesis, carried out by plants, algae, and some bacteria, removes CO₂ from the atmosphere and releases O₂. Respiration, carried out by nearly all living organisms, consumes O₂ and releases CO₂. This global cycle is in a delicate balance, with the processes essentially reversing each other, maintaining the composition of the atmosphere and making life on Earth possible for aerobic organisms.

18. Plants expertly balance their energy budget throughout the day. During daylight hours, the rate of photosynthesis typically exceeds the rate of respiration. This means the plant produces more glucose and oxygen than it consumes, allowing it to store the excess glucose as starch for later use. At night, photosynthesis stops, and the plant relies entirely on respiration, breaking down the stored starch to provide the continuous supply of ATP needed to maintain its life functions until sunrise.

19. Fermentation is a crucial survival mechanism for organisms in anaerobic conditions. When oxygen is unavailable for aerobic respiration, the cell's primary pathway for making ATP (the electron transport chain) shuts down. Fermentation provides an alternative route to regenerate the NAD+ molecules needed for glycolysis to continue. By allowing glycolysis to proceed, the cell can continue to produce a small but vital amount of ATP, enabling the organism to survive short periods without oxygen.

20. Photosynthesis is confined to the chloroplasts, which are organelles found only in the green parts of plants (mainly leaves) because they contain the necessary chlorophyll pigment to capture light. In contrast, respiration occurs in all living cells of an organism. It starts in the cytoplasm (glycolysis) and is completed in the mitochondria. This is because every single cell, whether in a root, stem, or leaf, requires a constant supply of energy to live, and mitochondria are the powerhouses that provide this energy.

21. Understanding respiration has numerous practical applications. In medicine, it is key to understanding metabolic diseases and the effects of oxygen deprivation. In agriculture, knowledge of root respiration helps in developing better soil management and irrigation practices to prevent waterlogging and crop failure. Industrially, the anaerobic respiration of yeast (fermentation) is the basis of the multi-billion dollar baking and brewing industries, while aerobic respiration of microbes is used in bioremediation and wastewater treatment.

22. The study of respiration is fundamental to understanding energy flow in ecosystems. It explains how the chemical energy, initially captured from sunlight by producers (plants) through photosynthesis, is transferred through the food chain. Consumers (herbivores, carnivores) obtain this energy by eating other organisms and then release it through their own respiration to power their life activities. This flow of energy from producers to consumers, with energy being lost as heat at each respiratory step, defines the structure and function of all ecosystems.

23. Several factors can affect the rate of respiration. Temperature is a key factor; as temperature rises, the rate of respiration increases up to an optimal point, beyond which enzymes denature. The concentration of oxygen and glucose (the reactants) also influences the rate; more reactants can lead to a faster rate, up to a saturation point. These factors are critical for an organism's survival, as its ability to produce energy must match its metabolic demands, which can change with activity level and environmental conditions.

24. The exothermic nature of respiration, meaning it releases energy, is biochemically significant because this is the very energy that sustains life. Organisms have evolved highly efficient mechanisms, primarily the electron transport chain in mitochondria, to capture a large portion of this released energy. Instead of losing it all as heat, it is trapped in the high-energy bonds of ATP. This captured energy is then readily available to drive all other endothermic (energy-requiring) reactions in the cell, from synthesizing molecules to muscle movement.

25. Photosynthesis and respiration are completely interdependent and essential for maintaining life on a global scale. Photosynthesis, performed by producers, is the ultimate source of nearly all organic matter and oxygen on Earth. Respiration, performed by almost all organisms, is the process that releases the energy stored in that organic matter. A disruption in photosynthesis would eliminate the food and oxygen supply, while a disruption in respiration would halt the recycling of carbon and prevent organisms from accessing energy, leading to a collapse of the global ecosystem.
