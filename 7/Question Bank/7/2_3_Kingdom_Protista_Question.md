## Section C: Short Answer Questions (2 marks each)

1.  Amoeba has a simple structure with an outer cell membrane enclosing the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm is differentiated into a clear, non-granular outer layer called ectoplasm and a granular inner layer called endoplasm, which contains the nucleus, contractile vacuole, and food vacuoles.
2.  Ingestion in Amoeba occurs via phagocytosis. When Amoeba senses a food particle, it extends its pseudopods to surround the particle, forming a food cup. The pseudopods then fuse, enclosing the food in a food vacuole.
3.  Digestion in Amoeba is intracellular. Lysosomes, containing digestive enzymes, fuse with the food vacuole. The enzymes break down the complex food molecules into simpler, soluble substances that can be absorbed by the cytoplasm.
4.  Amoeba moves using pseudopods in a process called amoeboid movement. This is achieved by cytoplasmic streaming, where the more fluid endoplasm flows forward into a projection, forming a pseudopod, and the rest of the cell follows.
5.  Respiration and excretion in Amoeba occur by diffusion through the general cell surface. Oxygen from the surrounding water diffuses in, and carbon dioxide diffuses out. Metabolic wastes like ammonia also diffuse out of the cell into the water.
6.  Binary fission is asexual reproduction under favorable conditions, where one Amoeba divides into two identical daughter cells. Multiple fission occurs under unfavorable conditions, where the Amoeba forms a cyst and its nucleus divides repeatedly to form many daughter cells (pseudopodiospores) that are released when conditions improve.
7.  During unfavorable conditions, Amoeba withdraws its pseudopods, becomes spherical, and secretes a protective, three-layered cyst wall. Inside, the nucleus divides multiple times. This process, called encystment, allows Amoeba to survive harsh conditions like drought and extreme temperatures.
8.  Organisms are placed in Kingdom Protista because they are eukaryotic (have a true nucleus), mostly unicellular, and can be autotrophic, heterotrophic, or mixotrophic. They are typically found in aquatic or moist environments.
9.  The contractile vacuole performs osmoregulation by collecting excess water from the cytoplasm. When it reaches a certain size, it moves to the cell surface and contracts, expelling the water to prevent the cell from bursting.
10. Food vacuoles are formed when Amoeba engulfs food particles. They serve as temporary stomachs where digestion occurs after fusion with lysosomes. After digestion and absorption of nutrients, the vacuole with undigested waste moves to the surface and is egested.
11. Ectoplasm is the clear, gel-like, non-granular outer layer of the cytoplasm just beneath the cell membrane. Endoplasm is the inner, fluid, granular region that contains all the cell organelles like the nucleus and vacuoles.
12. Amoeba responds to unfavorable conditions by encystment. It retracts its pseudopods, forms a round shape, and secretes a durable three-layered cyst wall that protects it from drying out or extreme temperatures until conditions become favorable again.
13. After digestion, the simple, soluble food molecules diffuse from the food vacuole into the surrounding cytoplasm; this is absorption. These absorbed molecules are then used by the cell for energy, growth, and repair, a process called assimilation.
14. The nucleus is the control center of the Amoeba. It contains the genetic material (DNA) and controls all metabolic activities, including growth, nutrition, respiration, and reproduction, by regulating protein synthesis.
15. The irregular and changing shape of Amoeba, due to the formation of pseudopods, is advantageous for locomotion and capturing food. It allows the Amoeba to move in any direction and engulf food particles of various sizes.
16. Protists exhibit diverse nutritional strategies. They can be autotrophic (e.g., algae performing photosynthesis), heterotrophic (e.g., Amoeba ingesting food), or mixotrophic (e.g., Euglena, which can photosynthesize or ingest food).
17. Pseudopods are vital for Amoeba's survival. They are used for locomotion, allowing the Amoeba to move towards food or away from danger. They are also used for feeding, enabling the Amoeba to engulf and ingest food particles.
18. During binary fission, the nucleus first replicates its genetic material and then divides into two identical nuclei. The cytoplasm then divides, ensuring that each new daughter cell receives a complete and identical set of genetic information from the parent.
19. The contractile vacuole is a membrane-bound organelle found in the cytoplasm of Amoeba. Its primary function is osmoregulation—it collects and expels excess water from the cell to maintain a proper water balance and prevent the cell from bursting.
20. Amoeba maintains water balance in its freshwater environment using its contractile vacuole. Since water constantly enters the cell by osmosis, the contractile vacuole actively collects this excess water and periodically expels it, preventing the cell from swelling and lysing.
21. Undigested food remains within the food vacuole. This vacuole then moves to the cell surface, fuses with the cell membrane, and ruptures, releasing the waste materials outside the cell in a process called egestion.
22. In favorable conditions with ample food and suitable temperature, Amoeba reproduces rapidly by binary fission. In unfavorable conditions, such as drought or lack of food, it switches to multiple fission within a protective cyst to ensure survival.
23. Membrane-bound organelles allow for the compartmentalization of cellular functions in protists. This separation increases the efficiency of metabolic processes, such as having digestion occur within lysosomes and energy production within mitochondria.
24. Cyst formation involves secreting a three-layered protective wall. This cyst protects the Amoeba from harsh environmental conditions like desiccation and extreme temperatures, allowing it to remain dormant until conditions improve, thus ensuring its survival.
25. Holozoic nutrition involves the ingestion of solid organic food particles. This is different from saprozoic nutrition (absorbing dissolved nutrients) and autotrophic nutrition (producing food through photosynthesis).
26. Diffusion is crucial for Amoeba's life. It allows for the intake of dissolved oxygen for respiration, the removal of carbon dioxide and ammonia as waste products, and the absorption of digested nutrients from the food vacuole into the cytoplasm.
27. Pseudopodiospores are the small, young Amoebae produced during multiple fission within a cyst. Each contains a nucleus and a small amount of cytoplasm. They are released when the cyst breaks and grow into adult Amoebae.
28. Amoeba's single cell contains all the necessary organelles to perform all life functions. The cell membrane controls entry and exit, the cytoplasm is the site of metabolic activities, the nucleus controls the cell, and vacuoles handle feeding and water balance.
29. Encystment is a key survival adaptation. It allows Amoeba to withstand periods of environmental stress that would otherwise be lethal, such as the drying up of a pond. This ensures the continuation of the species when favorable conditions return.
30. Protists are commonly found in aquatic habitats like ponds, lakes, oceans, and puddles. They also thrive in moist terrestrial environments such as damp soil, leaf litter, and on decaying organic matter.
31. Eukaryotic organization provides protists with greater structural complexity and functional efficiency. Membrane-bound organelles allow for specialized tasks to be performed in different compartments, leading to a more advanced level of cellular regulation and activity.
32. Egestion is the process of removing undigested waste from the Amoeba. The food vacuole containing the waste moves to the edge of the cell, fuses with the cell membrane, and then ruptures to release its contents into the surrounding environment.
33. During binary fission, the nucleus undergoes mitosis. It first elongates, and the chromatin material duplicates and separates. The nucleus then constricts in the middle and divides into two identical daughter nuclei.
34. Cytoplasmic streaming is the directed flow of the fluid endoplasm within the cell. This movement pushes against the cell membrane to form a pseudopod, and the continuous flow into the pseudopod is what propels the Amoeba forward.
35. Amoeba's primary protective mechanism during stress is encystment, where it forms a dormant, resistant cyst. This allows it to survive extreme temperatures, desiccation, and lack of food until the environment becomes hospitable again.
36. In Amoeba, structure is closely related to function. For example, the flexible cell membrane and fluid cytoplasm allow for the formation of pseudopods (structure) for movement and feeding (function). The contractile vacuole (structure) is essential for osmoregulation (function).
37. Amoeba obtains food through phagocytosis, using pseudopods to engulf it into a food vacuole. It then processes the food through intracellular digestion, where enzymes from lysosomes break down the food, followed by absorption and assimilation of nutrients.
38. Lysosomes are crucial for Amoeba's nutrition. These organelles contain powerful digestive enzymes. They fuse with food vacuoles and release their enzymes inside, enabling the breakdown of complex food particles into simple molecules that the cell can absorb and use.
39. Amoeba has two main reproductive adaptations. Binary fission allows for rapid population growth in good conditions. Multiple fission within a cyst is an adaptation for survival and dispersal during harsh conditions, ensuring the species persists.
40. Amoeba's metabolism, controlled by its nucleus, supports its survival by carrying out essential life processes. It uses assimilated food for cellular respiration to produce energy for movement, growth, and maintaining homeostasis, such as osmoregulation.
41. The contractile vacuole is especially significant for freshwater protists like Amoeba because they live in a hypotonic environment. Water constantly flows into the cell via osmosis, and without the contractile vacuole to expel this excess water, the cell would swell and burst.
42. Food cup formation is the first step of ingestion. When Amoeba detects a food particle, its cytoplasm flows to form two pseudopods that extend and surround the food. The space between these pseudopods forms the "food cup" before they fuse to create a food vacuole.
43. Multiple fission allows Amoeba to not only survive harsh conditions but also to reproduce in large numbers. When the cyst breaks, it releases many young Amoebae at once, increasing the chances of population survival and dispersal when favorable conditions return.
44. The cell membrane in Amoeba is a selectively permeable barrier that controls the passage of substances in and out of the cell. It is essential for respiration, excretion, and osmoregulation. Its flexibility is also key to locomotion and feeding.
45. Amoeba is a successful protist due to its simple structure, efficient holozoic nutrition, ability to move and adapt its shape, and its reproductive strategies. Its ability to form a cyst is a critical adaptation for surviving environmental instability.
46. Gaseous exchange in Amoeba occurs across its entire cell surface through diffusion. The large surface area-to-volume ratio of the single-celled organism allows for efficient exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide with the surrounding aquatic environment.
47. The various organelles in Amoeba work in a coordinated manner. The nucleus directs all activities. Pseudopods, controlled by cytoplasmic flow, capture food, which is then enclosed in a food vacuole. Lysosomes fuse with it for digestion, and the contractile vacuole maintains water balance throughout.
48. Protist distribution is influenced by factors like water availability, temperature, light (for autotrophs), and the presence of food sources. Most protists thrive in aquatic or moist environments and have specific temperature ranges for optimal growth and reproduction.
49. Amoeba demonstrates that a single cell can be highly complex. It performs all the essential functions of life—feeding, respiration, excretion, movement, and reproduction—through the coordinated action of its specialized organelles, showcasing a remarkable level of cellular organization.
50. Kingdom Protista is evolutionarily significant because it includes the earliest eukaryotes, forming a crucial link between the simpler prokaryotes and the more complex multicellular kingdoms (Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia). They represent a vast diversity of evolutionary experiments in eukaryotic life.

## Section D: Long Answer Questions (3 marks each)

1.  The process of nutrition in Amoeba is holozoic and involves five steps. First is **ingestion**, where Amoeba uses pseudopods to engulf a food particle and enclose it in a food vacuole. Second is **digestion**, an intracellular process where lysosomes fuse with the food vacuole and release digestive enzymes to break down the complex food. Third is **absorption**, where the digested, soluble nutrients diffuse from the food vacuole into the cytoplasm. Fourth is **assimilation**, where the cell uses these absorbed nutrients for energy, growth, and repair. The final step is **egestion**, where the food vacuole with undigested waste moves to the cell surface and expels its contents.
2.  Amoeba has a simple structure, characterized by its irregular shape. It is enclosed by a flexible **cell membrane**. The internal content, the **cytoplasm**, is divided into the outer, clear **ectoplasm** and the inner, granular **endoplasm**. The endoplasm contains several key organelles: a single, large **nucleus** that controls all cell activities; a **contractile vacuole** responsible for osmoregulation by expelling excess water; and temporary **food vacuoles** where ingested food is digested. It also forms **pseudopods**, which are temporary extensions used for movement and feeding.
3.  Binary fission and multiple fission are both forms of asexual reproduction in Amoeba. **Binary fission** occurs under favorable conditions. In this process, a single parent cell divides into two genetically identical daughter cells. It involves the division of the nucleus (mitosis) followed by the division of the cytoplasm. **Multiple fission**, however, is a response to unfavorable conditions. The Amoeba forms a protective cyst, and inside, the nucleus divides repeatedly to form many daughter nuclei, which then develop into pseudopodiospores. When conditions improve, the cyst ruptures, releasing numerous young Amoebae. The key difference is the number of offspring and the environmental trigger.
4.  Encystment is a survival mechanism used by Amoeba during unfavorable conditions like drought or extreme temperatures. The process begins with the Amoeba withdrawing its pseudopods and becoming spherical. It then secretes a tough, protective, three-layered wall called a cyst around itself, becoming metabolically inactive. This cyst protects the organism from desiccation and physical damage. Inside the cyst, the Amoeba can undergo multiple fission, producing many young Amoebae that are released when the cyst wall breaks upon the return of favorable conditions, ensuring the survival of the species.
5.  Amoeba, as a single cell, coordinates all its life processes efficiently. **Nutrition** is managed through the formation of pseudopods and food vacuoles, with lysosomes providing enzymes. **Respiration and excretion** rely on diffusion across the cell membrane, facilitated by the cell's large surface area-to-volume ratio. **Locomotion** is achieved through controlled cytoplasmic streaming to form pseudopods. **Osmoregulation** is handled by the contractile vacuole. All these processes are ultimately controlled by the **nucleus**, which directs the cell's metabolic activities and reproduction, either through binary or multiple fission depending on environmental cues.
6.  Kingdom Protista includes eukaryotic organisms that are mostly unicellular. They exhibit diverse modes of nutrition (autotrophic, heterotrophic, mixotrophic) and locomotion (cilia, flagella, pseudopods) and are typically found in aquatic or moist habitats. Amoeba is classified in this kingdom because it fits these criteria perfectly. It is a unicellular eukaryote with a true nucleus and organelles. It is heterotrophic (holozoic), moves using pseudopods, and lives in aquatic environments.
7.  Locomotion in Amoeba is achieved through the formation of pseudopods ("false feet"). This amoeboid movement is driven by the streaming of the cytoplasm. The inner, fluid endoplasm flows into a projection, extending it forward, while the outer ectoplasm provides a more gel-like tube for it to flow into. This same mechanism is directly related to its feeding behavior. To ingest food, the Amoeba extends its pseudopods to surround a food particle, demonstrating how locomotion and feeding are intrinsically linked processes.
8.  Amoeba maintains homeostasis, or a stable internal environment, through several mechanisms. It achieves **water balance (osmoregulation)** using the contractile vacuole, which actively collects and expels excess water that enters the cell via osmosis, preventing it from bursting. **Waste removal** is managed by diffusion. Harmful metabolic wastes, such as ammonia and carbon dioxide, are at a higher concentration inside the cell and diffuse across the cell membrane into the surrounding water, where the concentration is lower.
9.  Different organelles in Amoeba perform specialized functions crucial for survival. The **nucleus** is the control center, regulating all life processes. The **cell membrane** acts as a selective barrier, controlling what enters and leaves the cell. The **contractile vacuole** is vital for osmoregulation. **Food vacuoles** are temporary organelles for digestion, working in conjunction with **lysosomes**, which provide the necessary digestive enzymes. This division of labor within a single cell allows for efficient functioning.
10. Amoeba's reproductive strategies are adapted to its environment. Under **favorable conditions**, it uses **binary fission**, a rapid method of asexual reproduction that allows for quick population growth when resources are plentiful. Under **unfavorable conditions**, it employs **multiple fission** within a protective **cyst**. This strategy ensures the survival of the species through harsh periods and allows for the dispersal of a large number of offspring when conditions become suitable again.
11. Amoeba has several adaptations for its aquatic lifestyle. Its flexible **cell membrane** and lack of a rigid cell wall allow it to change shape for movement and feeding. The **contractile vacuole** is a critical adaptation for living in freshwater, as it prevents the cell from lysing due to the constant influx of water by osmosis. Its primary mode of respiration, by **diffusion** of dissolved oxygen from the water across its entire surface, is also perfectly suited for an aquatic existence.
12. Digestion in Amoeba is an intracellular process that occurs within a food vacuole. After ingesting a food particle, the food vacuole is formed. **Lysosomes**, which are organelles containing a variety of hydrolytic enzymes, fuse with the food vacuole. They release their enzymes into the vacuole, which then break down the complex, non-diffusible food molecules into simple, soluble molecules that can be absorbed and utilized by the cell.
13. Amoeba responds to environmental changes primarily through movement and changes in its reproductive strategy. It can move towards favorable stimuli like food or away from unfavorable ones. Its most significant response to severe environmental stress, such as the drying of its habitat, is **encystment**. By forming a dormant, resistant cyst, it can survive long periods of harsh conditions, only to re-emerge when the environment becomes hospitable again.
14. Pseudopods are central to Amoeba's life. These temporary, finger-like projections of the cytoplasm are formed by the controlled flow of endoplasm into an extension of the cell. Their significance is twofold: they are the primary means of **locomotion**, allowing the Amoeba to crawl along surfaces, and they are essential for **feeding**, as they are used to surround and engulf food particles in a process known as phagocytosis. The dynamic nature of pseudopods allows Amoeba to be a highly effective mobile predator in its microenvironment.
15. Respiration and excretion in Amoeba are simple yet efficient processes that rely on diffusion across the entire cell membrane. For **respiration**, dissolved oxygen from the surrounding water, being in higher concentration outside, diffuses into the cytoplasm. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide produced during metabolism, being in higher concentration inside, diffuses out. Similarly, for **excretion**, metabolic wastes like ammonia diffuse out of the cell down their concentration gradient. These processes are integrated with metabolism, which produces the waste, and circulation within the cytoplasm, which transports these substances.
16. The contractile vacuole is a spherical, membrane-bound organelle that plays a crucial role in osmoregulation. In its function, it gradually collects excess water from the cytoplasm (diastole) and then moves to the cell surface to contract and expel the water (systole). This cycle is vital for Amoeba's survival, especially in freshwater, which is hypotonic to its cytoplasm. Without this constant bailing of water, the cell would swell due to osmosis and eventually burst (lysis).
17. Holozoic nutrition is a type of heterotrophic nutrition that involves the ingestion of solid food particles. Amoeba is a classic example. The process involves **ingestion** (engulfing food), **digestion** (breaking it down with enzymes), **absorption** (taking nutrients into the cytoplasm), **assimilation** (using the nutrients), and **egestion** (expelling waste). This differs from other modes like **saprozoic nutrition**, which involves absorbing dissolved organic matter, and **autotrophic nutrition**, where an organism produces its own food, typically through photosynthesis.
18. Amoeba's cellular organization is that of a typical eukaryotic cell, but as a single-celled organism, this one cell must perform all functions of life. It has a **nucleus** to control activities, a **cell membrane** to regulate transport, and a **cytoplasm** with various organelles. The compartmentalization provided by organelles like food vacuoles, lysosomes, and the contractile vacuole allows for specialized processes like digestion and osmoregulation to occur efficiently and without interfering with each other, demonstrating how a single cell can be a complete, self-sufficient organism.
19. Binary fission in Amoeba begins with the replication of its genetic material and the division of the nucleus through mitosis. The nucleus elongates, constricts in the middle, and splits into two identical daughter nuclei. This is followed by cytokinesis, where the cytoplasm also constricts and divides, separating the parent cell into two smaller, genetically identical daughter Amoebae. The main advantage of this process is its speed, allowing for rapid population growth in ideal conditions. A limitation is that it produces no genetic variation, which can be a disadvantage if the environment changes.
20. Environmental conditions greatly affect Amoeba. Favorable conditions, including optimal temperature, moisture, and abundant food, lead to active growth, feeding, and rapid reproduction by binary fission. Unfavorable conditions, such as drought, extreme temperatures, or lack of food, trigger a survival response. Amoeba responds by retracting its pseudopods, ceasing movement and feeding, and entering a dormant state by forming a protective cyst (encystment), within which it may undergo multiple fission.
21. The nucleus is the most important organelle in Amoeba, acting as the cell's command center. It contains the organism's genetic blueprint (DNA) and controls all cellular activities by regulating gene expression and protein synthesis. It governs metabolism, growth, and repair. Furthermore, the nucleus is essential for reproduction, as its division (mitosis) is the critical first step in both binary and multiple fission, ensuring the faithful transmission of genetic information to the next generation.
22. Food vacuoles in Amoeba are temporary structures formed during the process of ingestion. When a food particle is engulfed by pseudopods, it becomes enclosed in a membrane-bound sac, the food vacuole. This vacuole then acts as a "stomach" where digestion occurs. Lysosomes fuse with it, releasing enzymes that break down the food. After the digested nutrients are absorbed into the cytoplasm, the vacuole, now containing only indigestible waste, moves to the cell surface to be expelled.
23. Amoeba's primary protective mechanism is the formation of a cyst during unfavorable conditions. It secretes a three-layered, chemically resistant wall that shields it from desiccation, extreme temperatures, and harmful chemicals. This encysted state is highly effective, allowing the organism to survive for long periods in a state of suspended animation. When conditions improve, the Amoeba can excyst and resume its normal life, making this a powerful adaptation for surviving in unstable environments.
24. In Amoeba, structure and function are intimately linked. The **irregular shape** and **fluid cytoplasm** (structure) are essential for forming pseudopods, which are used for **locomotion and feeding** (function). The **large surface area to volume ratio** (structure) facilitates efficient **diffusion** for respiration and excretion (function). The **contractile vacuole** (structure) is specifically designed for **osmoregulation** (function) by expelling water. This demonstrates a principle where every part of the cell's structure is optimized for a specific life-sustaining function.
25. Protists like Amoeba play an important ecological role as part of the microbial food web. As heterotrophs, they are consumers that feed on bacteria, algae, and detritus, helping to control bacterial populations and recycle nutrients in aquatic and soil ecosystems. They are also a food source for larger microscopic organisms. Evolutionarily, protists are highly significant as they represent the first eukaryotes, bridging the gap between simple prokaryotic life and the complex multicellular life of plants, animals, and fungi. They showcase the evolutionary origins of key eukaryotic features like the nucleus, mitochondria, and sexual reproduction.
