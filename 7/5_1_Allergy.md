## Concept of Allergy

An allergy is an exaggerated or abnormal immune response by the body to a substance (allergen) that is normally harmless to most people. When an allergic person comes into contact with an allergen, their immune system mistakenly identifies it as a threat and produces antibodies to fight it, leading to various symptoms.

## Allergens

Common allergens are substances that can trigger an allergic reaction. These include:

*   **Dust:** Contains dust mites, which are common allergens.
*   **Pollen Grain:** Tiny particles released by plants, especially during certain seasons.
*   **Mites:** Microscopic organisms found in dust, bedding, and carpets.
*   **Strong Sunlight:** Can cause skin rashes or other reactions in some sensitive individuals.
*   **Particular Food Items:** Common food allergens include peanuts, tree nuts, milk, eggs, soy, wheat, fish, and shellfish.

## Entry Routes of Allergens

Allergens can enter the body through various routes:

*   **Mouth:** Through ingestion of allergic food items.
*   **Nose:** Through inhalation of airborne allergens like pollen, dust, or pet dander.
*   **Skin:** Through direct contact with allergens (e.g., certain plants, chemicals, or insect stings).

## Symptoms of Allergic Reaction

The symptoms of an allergic reaction can vary widely in severity and type, depending on the allergen and the individual. Common symptoms include:

*   **Respiratory:** Sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion, itchy nose, watery eyes, coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath.
*   **Skin:** Rashes, hives (urticaria), itching, eczema.
*   **Digestive:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain (especially with food allergies).
*   **Systemic (severe cases):** Swelling of the face, lips, or throat (angioedema), difficulty breathing, drop in blood pressure, dizziness, loss of consciousness (anaphylaxis).

## Types of Allergies

*   **Seasonal Allergies (e.g., Hay Fever):** Occur during specific times of the year, usually triggered by airborne pollen from trees, grasses, or weeds.
*   **Perennial Allergies:** Occur year-round, triggered by allergens that are present indoors throughout the year, such as dust mites, pet dander, or mold.

## Precautions and Care to be Taken by a Person Prone to Allergies

*   **Identify and Avoid Allergens:** The most crucial step is to identify what triggers the allergy and then avoid exposure to it as much as possible.
*   **Medication:** Use antihistamines, decongestants, nasal sprays, or other prescribed medications to manage symptoms.
*   **Environmental Control:**
    *   Keep homes clean and dust-free.
    *   Use allergen-proof covers for mattresses and pillows.
    *   Use air purifiers.
    *   Avoid pets if allergic to dander.
*   **Dietary Management:** For food allergies, carefully read food labels and avoid trigger foods.
*   **Immunotherapy (Allergy Shots):** For severe allergies, a doctor might recommend a series of injections to desensitize the immune system to the allergen.
*   **Carry Emergency Medication:** Individuals with severe allergies (e.g., to insect stings or certain foods) should carry an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen) and know how to use it.
*   **Wear a Medical Alert Bracelet:** For severe allergies, this can inform others in an emergency.
