# Nervous System

## Main Parts

The human nervous system is broadly divided into:

1.  **Brain:** The control center of the nervous system.
2.  **Spinal Cord:** A long, thin, tubular bundle of nervous tissue.
3.  **Nerves:** Bundles of nerve fibers that transmit signals throughout the body.

## Brain

The brain is located inside the skull and is responsible for controlling thoughts, memory, emotions, touch, motor skills, vision, breathing, temperature, hunger, and every process that regulates our body.

*   **Cerebrum:**
    *   **Location:** The largest part of the brain, located in the upper front part of the skull.
    *   **Function:** Responsible for voluntary actions, thought, memory, intelligence, language, and sensory perception (e.g., sight, hearing, touch).
*   **Cerebellum:**
    *   **Location:** Located at the back of the brain, below the cerebrum.
    *   **Function:** Coordinates voluntary movements such as posture, balance, coordination, and speech, resulting in smooth and balanced muscular activity.
*   **Medulla Oblongata:**
    *   **Location:** The lowest part of the brainstem, connecting the brain to the spinal cord.
    *   **Function:** Controls vital involuntary functions such as breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, swallowing, and digestion.

## Spinal Cord

*   **Location:** Extends from the medulla oblongata down through the vertebral column.
*   **Function:** Serves as the main pathway for information to and from the brain. It also controls reflex actions.

## Nerves

*   **What are Nerves:** Nerves are bundles of nerve fibers (axons) that transmit electrical impulses (nerve signals) between the central nervous system and other parts of the body.
*   **General Function:** To transmit information rapidly throughout the body, enabling communication between different organs and systems, and coordinating responses to stimuli.
