# Kingdom Classification - Plantae

## Characteristics

*   **Multicellular:** Organisms in this kingdom are composed of many cells.
*   **Eukaryotic:** They possess a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.
*   **Autotrophic:** They produce their own food through photosynthesis, using chlorophyll.
*   **Cell Wall:** Possess rigid cell walls primarily made of cellulose.
*   **Reproduction:** Primarily reproduce sexually, but many also exhibit asexual reproduction.
*   **Habitat:** Mostly terrestrial, but some are aquatic.

## Major Divisions of the Plant Kingdom

The plant kingdom is divided into major groups based on key characteristics.

*   **Bryophytes (Non-Vascular Plants):**
    *   **Characteristics:** Lack true roots, stems, and leaves. Depend on moisture for reproduction. Reproduce by spores. The gametophyte generation is dominant.
    *   **Examples:** Mosses, liverworts, hornworts.

*   **Pteridophytes (Seedless Vascular Plants):**
    *   **Characteristics:** Possess vascular tissue (xylem and phloem). Have true roots, stems, and leaves. Reproduce by spores. The sporophyte generation is dominant.
    *   **Examples:** Ferns, horsetails, club mosses.

*   **Gymnosperms ("Naked Seed" Plants):**
    *   **Characteristics:** Seeds are not enclosed within a fruit. Do not produce flowers or fruits. Most are woody plants.
    *   **Examples:** Conifers, cycads, ginkgoes.

*   **Angiosperms (Flowering Plants):**
    *   **Characteristics:** The most diverse group of plants. Produce flowers and fruits. Seeds are enclosed within a fruit. Have a well-developed vascular system and exhibit double fertilization.
    *   **Examples:** Roses, mangoes, wheat.

## Examples

*   **Algae:** Simple aquatic plants (e.g., Spirogyra, Chlamydomonas).
*   **Mosses:** Non-vascular plants (e.g., Funaria).
*   **Ferns:** Vascular plants that reproduce by spores (e.g., Dryopteris).
*   **Flowering Plants:** The most diverse group of plants, reproducing by seeds enclosed within fruits (e.g., Rose, Mango, Wheat).
*   **Conifers:** Cone-bearing plants (e.g., Pine, Fir).
