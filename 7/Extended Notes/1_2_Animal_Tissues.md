## Epithelial Tissue

Epithelial tissue is a continuous layer of cells that covers internal and external surfaces of the body, providing protection and being involved in secretion, absorption, and filtration. Epithelial tissues are classified based on the shape of the cells and the number of cell layers.

### Classification by Cell Shape:
*   **Squamous Epithelium:** Flat and thin cells, resembling scales.
*   **Cuboidal Epithelium:** Cube-shaped cells.
*   **Columnar Epithelium:** Tall, column-shaped cells.

### Classification by Number of Layers:
*   **Simple Epithelium:** A single layer of cells.
*   **Stratified Epithelium:** Multiple layers of cells.
*   **Pseudostratified Epithelium:** Appears stratified but is a single layer of cells.

### Types of Epithelial Tissue:

*   **Simple Squamous Epithelium:**
    *   **Structure:** A single layer of flattened cells.
    *   **Function:** Allows for easy passage of materials through diffusion and filtration.
    *   **Location:** Lining of blood vessels (endothelium), air sacs of the lungs, and lining of body cavities (mesothelium).

*   **Simple Cuboidal Epithelium:**
    *   **Structure:** A single layer of cube-shaped cells.
    *   **Function:** Involved in secretion and absorption.
    *   **Location:** Glands, kidney tubules, and ducts.

*   **Simple Columnar Epithelium:**
    *   **Structure:** A single layer of tall, column-shaped cells.
    *   **Function:** Primarily involved in absorption and secretion.
    *   **Location:** Lines the digestive tract (stomach, intestines).

*   **Stratified Squamous Epithelium:**
    *   **Structure:** Multiple layers of cells with squamous cells on the surface.
    *   **Function:** Provides protection against abrasion, water loss, and invasion by microorganisms.
    *   **Location:** Outer layer of the skin (epidermis).

*   **Pseudostratified Columnar Epithelium:**
    *   **Structure:** Appears to be stratified but is a single layer of cells of varying heights.
    *   **Function:** Often ciliated and contains goblet cells to secrete mucus, which helps trap and move particles.
    *   **Location:** Lines the trachea and most of the upper respiratory tract.

*   **Transitional Epithelium:**
    *   **Structure:** A specialized stratified epithelium where the shape of the cells can change.
    *   **Function:** Allows for stretching and is adapted for extensibility.
    *   **Location:** Found exclusively in the urinary tract (bladder, ureters, urethra).

## Connective Tissue

Connective tissue is the most abundant and widely distributed of the primary tissues. It serves to connect, support, protect, and bind other tissues in the body. All connective tissue originates from the mesoderm. Its cells are typically loosely packed within an extracellular matrix (ECM).

### Components of Connective Tissue:
*   **Cells:** The primary cell is the fibroblast, which produces the ECM. Other cells include immune cells and adipocytes.
*   **Ground Substance:** A gel-like substance that fills the space between cells and fibers.
*   **Fibers:**
    *   **Collagen Fibers:** Strong and flexible, providing high tensile strength.
    *   **Elastic Fibers:** Can be stretched and return to their original shape.
    *   **Reticular Fibers:** Form a delicate, branching network to support other tissues.

### Types of Connective Tissue:

*   **Connective Tissue Proper:**
    *   **Loose Connective Tissue (Areolar):** Found around blood vessels and between most body organs. Acts as a shock absorber and provides support and elasticity.
    *   **Dense Connective Tissue:**
        *   **Dense Regular:** Collagen fibers are arranged in parallel. Found in tendons and ligaments.
        *   **Dense Irregular:** Collagen fibers are arranged randomly. Found in the dermis of the skin.
*   **Specialized Connective Tissue:**
    *   **Adipose Tissue:** Stores energy, insulates, and protects organs.
    *   **Cartilage:** Flexible and strong, protects bones and joints.
    *   **Bone:** Hard, mineralized tissue that provides structural support.
    *   **Blood and Lymph:** Fluid connective tissues with a liquid ECM (plasma).
    *   **Reticular Tissue:** Forms a supportive framework for organs like the spleen and lymph nodes.

## Muscular Tissue

Muscular tissue is a specialized tissue responsible for movement through contraction. Muscle cells, or muscle fibers, are excitable and contractile.

### Types of Muscular Tissue:

*   **Skeletal Muscle:**
    *   **Structure:** Long, cylindrical, multinucleated cells with a striated (striped) appearance.
    *   **Function:** Responsible for voluntary movements.
    *   **Control:** Voluntary.
    *   **[Diagram of Skeletal Muscle]**

*   **Cardiac Muscle:**
    *   **Structure:** Found only in the heart. Striated, branched cells with a single nucleus. Connected by intercalated discs.
    *   **Function:** Pumps blood throughout the body.
    *   **Control:** Involuntary.

*   **Smooth Muscle:**
    *   **Structure:** Spindle-shaped cells with a single nucleus. Lacks striations.
    *   **Function:** Found in the walls of hollow organs. Facilitates functions like digestion and blood flow.
    *   **Control:** Involuntary.

## Nerve Tissue

Nerve tissue is the main component of the nervous system (brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves). It is responsible for regulating and controlling body functions by forming a communication network that transmits electrical signals.

### Components of Nerve Tissue:

*   **Neurons (Nerve Cells):** The primary functional units of the nervous system.
    *   **Cell Body (Soma):** Contains the nucleus and other organelles.
    *   **Dendrites:** Branched extensions that receive signals from other neurons.
    *   **Axon:** A long projection that carries nerve impulses away from the cell body.
*   **Neuroglia (Glial Cells):** Non-conductive cells that support, insulate, and protect the neurons.
