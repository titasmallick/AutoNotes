## Mechanism of an Allergic Reaction

An allergic reaction is an exaggerated immune response to a typically harmless substance known as an allergen. The mechanism involves two main stages: sensitization and the allergic reaction itself.

### 1. Sensitization: The First Encounter

*   **Antigen Presentation:** When an allergen enters the body for the first time, it is taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APCs).
*   **T-Cell Activation and B-Cell Stimulation:** APCs present the allergen to T helper cells, which then stimulate B cells.
*   **IgE Production:** B cells differentiate into plasma cells and produce Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies specific to the allergen.
*   **Mast Cell and Basophil Binding:** IgE antibodies bind to the surface of mast cells and basophils. The individual is now "sensitized."

### 2. Allergic Reaction: Subsequent Encounters

*   **Early-Phase Reaction (Immediate):**
    *   **Allergen Cross-Linking:** Upon re-exposure, the allergen binds to the IgE antibodies on mast cells and basophils.
    *   **Degranulation and Mediator Release:** This triggers the release of chemical mediators, most notably histamine.
    *   **Symptoms:** Histamine causes itching, increased mucus production, smooth muscle contraction, and increased permeability of blood vessels, leading to swelling and hives.
*   **Late-Phase Reaction (Delayed):**
    *   **Inflammatory Cell Recruitment:** Mediators released during the early phase attract other inflammatory cells to the site.
    *   **Sustained Inflammation and Tissue Damage:** The arrival of these cells leads to a more sustained and widespread inflammation, which can cause tissue damage.

## Allergens

Common allergens are substances that can trigger an allergic reaction. These include:

*   **Dust:** Contains dust mites, which are common allergens.
*   **Pollen Grain:** Tiny particles released by plants, especially during certain seasons.
*   **Mites:** Microscopic organisms found in dust, bedding, and carpets.
*   **Strong Sunlight:** Can cause skin rashes or other reactions in some sensitive individuals.
*   **Particular Food Items:** Common food allergens include peanuts, tree nuts, milk, eggs, soy, wheat, fish, and shellfish.

## Entry Routes of Allergens

Allergens can enter the body through various routes:

*   **Mouth:** Through ingestion of allergic food items.
*   **Nose:** Through inhalation of airborne allergens like pollen, dust, or pet dander.
*   **Skin:** Through direct contact with allergens (e.g., certain plants, chemicals, or insect stings).

## Symptoms of Allergic Reaction

The symptoms of an allergic reaction can vary widely in severity and type, depending on the allergen and the individual. Common symptoms include:

*   **Respiratory:** Sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion, itchy nose, watery eyes, coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath.
*   **Skin:** Rashes, hives (urticaria), itching, eczema.
*   **Digestive:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain (especially with food allergies).
*   **Systemic (severe cases):** Swelling of the face, lips, or throat (angioedema), difficulty breathing, drop in blood pressure, dizziness, loss of consciousness (anaphylaxis).

## Types of Allergies

*   **Seasonal Allergies (e.g., Hay Fever):** Occur during specific times of the year, usually triggered by airborne pollen from trees, grasses, or weeds.
*   **Perennial Allergies:** Occur year-round, triggered by allergens that are present indoors throughout the year, such as dust mites, pet dander, or mold.

## Precautions and Care to be Taken by a Person Prone to Allergies

*   **Identify and Avoid Allergens:** The most crucial step is to identify what triggers the allergy and then avoid exposure to it as much as possible.
*   **Medication:** Use antihistamines, decongestants, nasal sprays, or other prescribed medications to manage symptoms.
*   **Environmental Control:**
    *   Keep homes clean and dust-free.
    *   Use allergen-proof covers for mattresses and pillows.
    *   Use air purifiers.
    *   Avoid pets if allergic to dander.
*   **Dietary Management:** For food allergies, carefully read food labels and avoid trigger foods.
*   **Immunotherapy (Allergy Shots):** For severe allergies, a doctor might recommend a series of injections to desensitize the immune system to the allergen.
*   **Carry Emergency Medication:** Individuals with severe allergies (e.g., to insect stings or certain foods) should carry an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen) and know how to use it.
*   **Wear a Medical Alert Bracelet:** For severe allergies, this can inform others in an emergency.
