# Kingdom Classification - Monera

## Characteristics

*   **Unicellular:** Organisms in this kingdom are single-celled.
*   **Prokaryotic:** They lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.
*   **Cell Wall:** Most have a cell wall, but it is not made of cellulose.
*   **Nutrition:** Can be autotrophic (photosynthetic or chemosynthetic) or heterotrophic.
*   **Reproduction:** Primarily by binary fission.

## Bacterial Cell Structure

Bacterial cells have a simple but robust structure that enables them to thrive in diverse environments.

*   **External Structures:**
    *   **Capsule/Glycocalyx:** An outer layer that protects the cell from dehydration and phagocytosis.
    *   **Flagella:** Long, whip-like appendages for motility.
    *   **Pili and Fimbriae:** Hair-like appendages for attachment and conjugation.
*   **Cell Envelope:**
    *   **Cell Wall:** Provides structural support and protection. Composed of peptidoglycan.
    *   **Plasma Membrane:** A phospholipid bilayer that regulates the passage of substances.
*   **Internal Structures:**
    *   **Cytoplasm:** The gel-like substance that fills the cell.
    *   **Nucleoid:** The region containing the bacterium's genetic material (a single, circular chromosome).
    *   **Ribosomes:** Responsible for protein synthesis.
    *   **Plasmids:** Small, circular, extrachromosomal DNA molecules that often carry genes for antibiotic resistance.

## Archaebacteria vs. Eubacteria

The Kingdom Monera is divided into two sub-kingdoms: Archaebacteria and Eubacteria.

*   **Archaebacteria:**
    *   These are ancient bacteria that live in extreme environments.
    *   Their cell walls lack peptidoglycan.
    *   Examples: Methanogens (produce methane), Halophiles (live in salty environments), Thermoacidophiles (live in hot, acidic environments).
*   **Eubacteria:**
    *   These are "true" bacteria.
    *   Their cell walls are made of peptidoglycan.
    *   Examples: Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae), Lactobacillus, E. coli.

## Bacteria

*   **Shape:** Bacteria can have various shapes:
    *   **Cocci:** Spherical (e.g., Streptococcus)
    *   **Bacilli:** Rod-shaped (e.g., Lactobacillus)
    *   **Spirilla:** Spiral-shaped (e.g., Spirillum)
    *   **Vibrio:** Comma-shaped (e.g., Vibrio cholerae)

### Useful Bacteria (Applications related to daily life)

*   **Food Production:** Used in making yogurt, cheese, buttermilk, and vinegar.
*   **Medicine:** Used to produce antibiotics (e.g., Streptomycin) and vaccines.
*   **Agriculture:** Nitrogen-fixing bacteria (e.g., Rhizobium) convert atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form for plants, enriching soil fertility.
*   **Decomposition:** Decomposers break down dead organic matter, recycling nutrients in the ecosystem.
*   **Bioremediation:** Used to clean up oil spills and other pollutants.

### Harmful Bacteria (Applications related to daily life)

*   **Diseases:** Cause various diseases in humans (e.g., Cholera, Tuberculosis, Typhoid), animals, and plants.
*   **Food Spoilage:** Cause food to rot and become unfit for consumption.
*   **Denitrification:** Some bacteria convert nitrates back into atmospheric nitrogen, reducing soil fertility.
