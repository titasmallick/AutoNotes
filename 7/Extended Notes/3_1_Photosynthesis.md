# Photosynthesis

## Definition

Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll, carbon dioxide, and water. It converts light energy into chemical energy.

## The Two Stages of Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis is a complex process that can be divided into two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle.

### 1. Light-Dependent Reactions

*   **Location:** Thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts.
*   **Purpose:** To convert solar energy into chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Light Absorption:** Chlorophyll absorbs sunlight, exciting electrons.
    2.  **Water Splitting:** Water molecules are split, releasing electrons, protons (H+), and oxygen.
    3.  **Electron Transport Chain:** High-energy electrons travel through a series of proteins, releasing energy that is used to pump protons and create a proton gradient.
    4.  **ATP Synthesis:** The proton gradient drives ATP synthase to produce ATP.
    5.  **NADPH Formation:** High-energy electrons are transferred to NADP+ to form NADPH.

### 2. Calvin Cycle (Light-Independent Reactions)

*   **Location:** Stroma of the chloroplasts.
*   **Purpose:** To use the ATP and NADPH from the light-dependent reactions to convert carbon dioxide into glucose.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Carbon Fixation:** CO₂ combines with RuBP, a five-carbon sugar, to form an unstable six-carbon compound that immediately splits into two molecules of 3-PGA.
    2.  **Reduction:** ATP and NADPH are used to convert 3-PGA into G3P, a three-carbon sugar.
    3.  **Regeneration:** For every six molecules of G3P produced, one is used to make glucose and other organic molecules, while the other five are used to regenerate RuBP.

## Factors Affecting Photosynthesis

1.  **Light:** Light provides the energy for the process. The rate of photosynthesis increases with light intensity up to a certain point.
2.  **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂):** CO₂ is a raw material. An increase in CO₂ concentration generally increases the rate of photosynthesis, provided other factors are optimal.
3.  **Water:** Water is also a raw material. A shortage of water can reduce the rate of photosynthesis.
4.  **Chlorophyll:** The green pigment that absorbs light energy. Without chlorophyll, photosynthesis cannot occur.

## Significance of Photosynthesis

*   **Food Production:** It is the primary source of food for almost all life on Earth, either directly (plants) or indirectly (animals eating plants or other animals).
*   **Oxygen Release:** It releases oxygen into the atmosphere, which is essential for the respiration of most living organisms.
*   **Carbon Cycle:** It helps in maintaining the balance of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the atmosphere.

## Experiment to Demonstrate Photosynthesis Process

**Aim:** To show that sunlight is necessary for photosynthesis.

**Setup:**

1.  Take a potted plant and destarch it by keeping it in a dark room for 2-3 days. (This ensures that any starch present in the leaves is used up).
2.  Cover a part of one of its leaves with a black paper clip or aluminum foil on both sides, ensuring no light reaches the covered part.
3.  Keep the potted plant in sunlight for 6-8 hours.
4.  Pluck the covered leaf and remove the black paper.
5.  Boil the leaf in water for a few minutes (to break down cell walls).
6.  Then, boil the leaf in alcohol (in a water bath) to remove the chlorophyll (decolorization). The leaf will turn pale white.
7.  Wash the leaf with water and then dip it in a dilute solution of iodine.

**Observation:**

*   The part of the leaf that was exposed to sunlight turns blue-black (indicating the presence of starch).
*   The part of the leaf that was covered with black paper remains yellowish-brown (indicating the absence of starch).

**Conclusion:** This experiment shows that sunlight is necessary for photosynthesis to produce starch.
