# Kingdom Classification

## Meaning and Concept of Classification

**Classification:** The process of arranging organisms into groups or categories based on their similarities and differences. It helps in organizing the vast diversity of life forms on Earth.

## Need and Advantages of Classification

*   **Easy Study:** It makes the study of a wide variety of organisms easier and systematic.
*   **Identification:** Helps in identifying new organisms by comparing them with known ones.
*   **Relationships:** Reveals the relationships among different groups of organisms.
*   **Evolutionary Studies:** Provides a basis for understanding the evolutionary history of organisms.
*   **Communication:** Provides a universal system for naming and categorizing organisms, facilitating communication among scientists worldwide.

## History of Kingdom Classification

The way scientists classify life has evolved significantly over time, reflecting our expanding knowledge of the diversity of life, especially at the microscopic level.

*   **The Two-Kingdom System:**
    *   **Carolus Linnaeus (18th century):** Established the first formal system, dividing all living organisms into two kingdoms:
        *   **Plantae:** Immobile organisms with cell walls that produce their own food (included plants, fungi, and bacteria).
        *   **Animalia:** Mobile organisms that lack cell walls and ingest food (included animals and protozoa).

*   **The Three-Kingdom System:**
    *   **Ernst Haeckel (1866):** Proposed a third kingdom to address the discovery of microorganisms:
        *   **Protista:** Included unicellular organisms like bacteria, protozoa, and algae.

*   **The Five-Kingdom System:**
    *   **Robert Whittaker (1969):** Proposed a five-kingdom system based on cell structure, mode of nutrition, and body organization:
        *   **Monera:** Unicellular prokaryotic organisms (bacteria).
        *   **Protista:** Unicellular eukaryotic organisms.
        *   **Fungi:** Multicellular, saprotrophic organisms with cell walls (mushrooms, molds).
        *   **Plantae:** Multicellular, autotrophic organisms.
        *   **Animalia:** Multicellular, heterotrophic organisms.

*   **The Six-Kingdom System:**
    *   **Carl Woese (late 1970s):** Divided the Monera kingdom based on genetic differences in prokaryotes:
        *   **Archaebacteria:** Single-celled prokaryotes often found in extreme environments.
        *   **Eubacteria:** "True" bacteria.
        *   **Protista**
        *   **Fungi**
        *   **Plantae**
        *   **Animalia**

*   **The Three-Domain System:**
    *   **Carl Woese, Otto Kandler, and Mark Wheelis (1990):** Introduced a new, higher level of classification called the **domain**, based on differences in ribosomal RNA (rRNA):
        *   **Archaea:** Corresponds to the kingdom Archaebacteria.
        *   **Bacteria:** Corresponds to the kingdom Eubacteria.
        *   **Eukarya:** Includes all organisms with eukaryotic cells (Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia).
