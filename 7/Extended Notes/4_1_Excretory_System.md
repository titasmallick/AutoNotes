# Excretory System

## Excretion

**Definition:** The process of removal of metabolic waste products and excess substances from the body of an organism.

## Organs and their Excretory Products

*   **Kidneys:** Primary excretory organs, remove nitrogenous wastes (urea, uric acid, creatinine), excess salts, and water from the blood to form urine.
*   **Sweat Glands (Skin):** Excrete excess water, salts, and a small amount of urea through sweat.
*   **Lungs:** Excrete carbon dioxide and water vapor during respiration.

## Renal Excretory System

The urinary system is the main excretory system in humans.

*   **Kidneys:**
    *   **Location:** A pair of bean-shaped organs located on either side of the spine, just below the rib cage.
    *   **Function:** Filter blood to remove waste products and produce urine.
*   **Ureters:**
    *   **Location:** Two tubes extending from the kidneys to the urinary bladder.
    *   **Function:** Transport urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder.
*   **Urinary Bladder:**
    *   **Location:** A muscular sac located in the pelvis.
    *   **Function:** Stores urine until it is ready to be expelled from the body.
*   **Urethra:**
    *   **Location:** A tube extending from the urinary bladder to the outside of the body.
    *   **Function:** Carries urine from the bladder out of the body.

## The Nephron: The Functional Unit of the Kidney

The nephron is the microscopic functional unit of the kidney, responsible for filtering blood and forming urine. Each kidney contains approximately one million nephrons.

### Structure of the Nephron

The nephron consists of two main parts: the renal corpuscle and the renal tubule.

*   **Renal Corpuscle:**
    *   **Glomerulus:** A tangled cluster of tiny blood capillaries.
    *   **Bowman's Capsule:** A double-walled, cup-shaped structure that surrounds the glomerulus and collects the filtered fluid.
*   **Renal Tubule:**
    *   **Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT):** The first section of the renal tubule, where most of the reabsorption occurs.
    *   **Loop of Henle:** A U-shaped tube that descends into the renal medulla and is responsible for concentrating the urine.
    *   **Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT):** The segment responsible for the fine-tuning of electrolyte balance.
    *   **Collecting Duct:** The final segment of the nephron, where the final concentration of urine occurs.

### Function of the Nephron

The nephron performs three main functions to produce urine:

1.  **Glomerular Filtration:** Blood pressure forces water, salts, glucose, and urea from the blood in the glomerulus into the Bowman's capsule, forming a fluid called filtrate.
2.  **Tubular Reabsorption:** As the filtrate flows through the renal tubule, most of the water and many of the solutes are reabsorbed back into the blood.
3.  **Tubular Secretion:** Waste products and excess ions that were not filtered in the glomerulus are actively transported from the blood into the filtrate.

## Common Disorders of the Urinary System

*   **Urinary Tract Infection (UTI):** An infection in any part of the urinary system, often caused by bacteria.
*   **Kidney Stone:** Hard deposits made of minerals and salts that form inside the kidneys.
