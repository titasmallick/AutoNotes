# Kingdom Classification - Animalia

## Characteristics

*   **Multicellular:** Organisms in this kingdom are composed of many cells.
*   **Eukaryotic:** They possess a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.
*   **Heterotrophic:** They obtain nutrients by ingesting other organisms or organic matter.
*   **No Cell Wall:** Animal cells do not have a cell wall.
*   **Motility:** Most animals are capable of locomotion.
*   **Reproduction:** Primarily reproduce sexually.

## (a) Vertebrates

Vertebrates are animals that possess a backbone or spinal column.

*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   Presence of a vertebral column (backbone).
    *   Well-developed internal skeleton.
    *   Complex nervous system with a brain enclosed in a cranium.
    *   Bilateral symmetry.
    *   Closed circulatory system.

*   **Examples:** Fish, Amphibians, Reptiles, Birds, Mammals.

## (b) Invertebrates

Invertebrates are animals that do not possess a backbone or spinal column. They constitute the vast majority of animal species.

### 9 Major Phyla

1.  **Porifera (Sponges):**
    *   **Characteristics:** Simplest multicellular animals, sessile, porous body, filter feeders.
    *   **Example:** Sponges (e.g., Sycon).
2.  **Cnidaria (Coelenterata):**
    *   **Characteristics:** Radial symmetry, stinging cells (cnidocytes), sac-like body with a single opening (mouth/anus).
    *   **Example:** Jellyfish, Hydra, Sea Anemones, Corals.
3.  **Platyhelminthes (Flatworms):**
    *   **Characteristics:** Dorsoventrally flattened body, bilateral symmetry, acoelomate (no body cavity), parasitic or free-living.
    *   **Example:** Tapeworms, Planaria, Liver Fluke.
4.  **Nematoda (Roundworms):**
    *   **Characteristics:** Cylindrical, unsegmented body, pseudocoelomate (false body cavity), many are parasitic.
    *   **Example:** Ascaris, Filarial worms.
5.  **Annelida (Segmented Worms):**
    *   **Characteristics:** Segmented body, true coelom, well-developed organ systems.
    *   **Example:** Earthworms, Leeches.
6.  **Arthropoda:**
    *   **Characteristics:** Jointed legs, chitinous exoskeleton, segmented body, most diverse phylum.
    *   **Example:** Insects (e.g., Cockroach, Butterfly), Spiders, Crabs.
7.  **Mollusca:**
    *   **Characteristics:** Soft body, usually protected by a shell, muscular foot, mantle.
    *   **Example:** Snails, Clams, Octopuses.
8.  **Echinodermata:**
    *   **Characteristics:** Spiny skin, radial symmetry (in adults), water vascular system.
    *   **Example:** Starfish, Sea Urchins.
