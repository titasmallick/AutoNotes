# Fertilisation

Fertilisation is the fusion of gametes to give rise to a new individual organism or offspring and initiate its development.

## Events Post-Pollination

After pollination, the pollen grain germinates on the stigma and a pollen tube grows down to the ovule. The male gametes are released into the ovule and one of them fuses with the egg cell to form a zygote.

## Double Fertilisation and Triple Fusion

*   **Double Fertilisation:** A complex fertilization mechanism of flowering plants (angiosperms). This process involves the joining of a female gametophyte (megagametophyte, also called the embryo sac) with two male gametes (sperm).
*   **Triple Fusion:** The fusion of the second male gamete with the two polar nuclei to form the endosperm.

## Fruit and Seed

*   **Fruit:** The mature ovary of a flowering plant, enclosing the seed or seeds.
*   **Seed:** A flowering plant's unit of reproduction, capable of developing into another such plant.

## Significance

*   **Fruit:** Protects the seeds and helps in their dispersal.
*   **Seed:** Contains the embryo and food reserves for its development.
