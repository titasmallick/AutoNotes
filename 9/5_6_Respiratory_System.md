# Respiratory System

## Organs and Mechanism of Breathing

*   **Nose:** The primary opening for the respiratory system.
*   **Pharynx:** A passageway for both air and food.
*   **Larynx:** The voice box.
*   **Trachea:** The windpipe.
*   **Bronchi:** Two tubes that branch off from the trachea and lead to the lungs.
*   **Lungs:** The main organs of the respiratory system.
*   **Mechanism of Breathing:** The process of moving air into and out of the lungs.

## Tissue Respiration and Heat Production

*   **Tissue Respiration:** The process by which cells break down glucose to release energy.
*   **Heat Production:** A byproduct of tissue respiration.

## Diaphragm and Intercostal Muscles

*   **Diaphragm:** A large, dome-shaped muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity.
*   **Intercostal Muscles:** Muscles that are located between the ribs.

## Anaerobic Respiration

*   **Comparison in Plants and Man:** In plants, anaerobic respiration produces ethanol and carbon dioxide. In man, anaerobic respiration produces lactic acid.

## Gaseous Transport and Respiratory Volumes

*   **Gaseous Transport:** The process by which oxygen and carbon dioxide are transported in the blood.
*   **Respiratory Volumes:** The amount of air that can be moved into and out of the lungs.

## Altitude Effects, Asphyxiation, and Hypoxia

*   **Altitude Effects:** The effects of high altitude on the body, such as shortness of breath and dizziness.
*   **Asphyxiation:** A condition in which the body is deprived of oxygen.
*   **Hypoxia:** A condition in which the body or a region of the body is deprived of adequate oxygen supply at the tissue level.
