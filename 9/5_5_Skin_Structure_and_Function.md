# Skin Structure & Function

## Parts and Functions

*   **Epidermis:** The outer layer of the skin, which provides a waterproof barrier and creates our skin tone.
*   **Dermis:** The layer of skin beneath the epidermis, which contains tough connective tissue, hair follicles, and sweat glands.
*   **Hypodermis:** The layer of skin beneath the dermis, which is made of fat and connective tissue.

## Derivatives

*   **Sweat Glands:** Glands that produce sweat, which helps to cool the body.
*   **Sebaceous Glands:** Glands that produce sebum, which helps to keep the skin moist.
*   **Hair:** A protein filament that grows from follicles found in the dermis.
*   **Nails:** A horn-like envelope covering the dorsal aspect of the terminal phalanges of fingers and toes in most primates.
*   **Mammary Glands:** The milk-producing gland of female mammals.

## Heat Regulation

*   **Vasodilation:** The widening of blood vessels, which allows more blood to flow to the skin and release heat.
*   **Vasoconstriction:** The narrowing of blood vessels, which reduces blood flow to the skin and conserves heat.
