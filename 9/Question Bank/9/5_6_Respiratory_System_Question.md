## Section C: Two Mark Questions

1.  Air enters through the **nose**, passes through the **pharynx**, then the **larynx**, down the **trachea**, into the **bronchi**, and finally reaches the **lungs**.
2.  The **diaphragm** is a large, dome-shaped muscle that separates the chest and abdominal cavities. It contracts and moves down during inspiration, increasing lung volume.
3.  In plants, anaerobic respiration produces **ethanol and carbon dioxide**. In humans, anaerobic respiration produces **lactic acid**.
4.  During inspiration, the **diaphragm contracts and moves down**, and the **intercostal muscles contract**, pulling the ribs up and out. This increases the volume of the chest cavity, drawing air into the lungs.
5.  During expiration, the **diaphragm relaxes and moves up**, and the **intercostal muscles relax**, allowing the ribs to move down and in. This decreases the volume of the chest cavity, forcing air out of the lungs.
6.  **Tissue respiration** is the process by which cells break down glucose to release energy. **Heat is produced** as a byproduct of this energy-releasing metabolic process.
7.  **Intercostal muscles** are located between the ribs. They contract during inspiration to pull the ribs up and out, and relax during expiration to allow the ribs to move down and in, facilitating breathing movements.
8.  **Gaseous transport** involves oxygen binding to hemoglobin in red blood cells and being carried to tissues. Carbon dioxide is transported mainly as bicarbonate ions in the plasma, with some bound to hemoglobin.
9.  **Respiratory volumes** measure the amount of air moved into and out of the lungs. Key volumes include Tidal Volume (normal breath), Vital Capacity (max exhaled after max inhale), and Residual Volume (air remaining after max exhale). They indicate lung function.
10. High altitude leads to lower atmospheric pressure and reduced oxygen availability. This causes **shortness of breath** and **dizziness** as the body struggles to get enough oxygen.
11. **Asphyxiation** is a severe condition where the body is completely deprived of oxygen. **Hypoxia** is a condition where there is an inadequate supply of oxygen at the tissue level, which can be less severe than asphyxiation.
12. The **pharynx** serves as a common passageway. It allows both **air** to pass from the nasal cavity to the larynx and **food** to pass from the mouth to the esophagus.
13. The **larynx**, or voice box, contains vocal cords. As air passes over these cords during exhalation, they vibrate, producing sounds that are then modulated by the tongue, teeth, and lips to form speech.
14. The **trachea** is the windpipe, a tube supported by C-shaped cartilage rings. Its function is to provide a clear airway for air to enter and exit the lungs, preventing collapse.
15. The **trachea** branches into two main **bronchi**, one leading to each lung. These main bronchi then further divide into smaller and smaller bronchioles, forming the bronchial tree.
16. **Alveoli** are tiny air sacs in the lungs. Their thin walls and large surface area facilitate efficient **gas exchange**, allowing oxygen to diffuse into the blood and carbon dioxide to diffuse out.
17. Oxygen binds to the iron-containing heme group of **hemoglobin** molecules within red blood cells. This forms oxyhemoglobin, a reversible bond that allows oxygen to be released at tissues.
18. Carbon dioxide is transported in the blood primarily as **bicarbonate ions** (about 70%), formed in red blood cells. A smaller amount is transported bound to hemoglobin (carbaminohemoglobin) or dissolved in plasma.
19. **Carbonic anhydrase** is an enzyme found in red blood cells. It rapidly catalyzes the reversible reaction of carbon dioxide and water to form carbonic acid, which then dissociates into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions, crucial for CO2 transport.
20. The **oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve** illustrates the relationship between the partial pressure of oxygen and the percentage of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen. It shows how readily hemoglobin binds and releases oxygen under different conditions.
21. The **Bohr effect** describes how an increase in CO2 or a decrease in pH (acidity) shifts the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the right. This means hemoglobin releases oxygen more readily to tissues that are metabolically active and producing more CO2 and acid.
22. The **Haldane effect** states that the deoxygenation of hemoglobin increases its ability to carry carbon dioxide. This is because deoxygenated hemoglobin has a higher affinity for CO2 and H+ ions, facilitating CO2 uptake at tissues and release at the lungs.
23. **2,3-DPG** (2,3-bisphosphoglycerate) is a molecule in red blood cells that binds to hemoglobin and reduces its affinity for oxygen. This promotes oxygen release to tissues, especially important at high altitudes or in conditions of hypoxia.
24. The **chloride shift** is a process where bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) move out of red blood cells into the plasma, and chloride ions (Cl-) move into the red blood cells. This maintains electrical neutrality during CO2 transport.
25. The **medulla oblongata** in the brainstem contains the primary respiratory control centers. It generates the basic rhythm of breathing, sending signals to the diaphragm and intercostal muscles.
26. The **pons** contains respiratory centers (pneumotaxic and apneustic) that fine-tune the breathing rhythm generated by the medulla. They regulate the depth and rate of breathing, ensuring smooth transitions between inspiration and expiration.
27. **Chemoreceptors** (central in medulla, peripheral in carotid and aortic bodies) detect changes in blood pH, CO2, and O2 levels. They send signals to the respiratory centers to adjust breathing rate and depth to maintain homeostasis.
28. **Dead space** refers to the volume of air in the respiratory system that does not participate in gas exchange. Anatomical dead space is the volume of the conducting airways, while physiological dead space includes anatomical dead space plus any non-functional alveoli.
29. **Surfactant** is a lipoprotein substance produced by alveolar cells. It reduces the surface tension within the alveoli, preventing them from collapsing during exhalation and making breathing easier.
30. The **respiratory membrane** is the thin barrier across which gas exchange occurs in the lungs. It consists of the alveolar epithelial cell, the capillary endothelial cell, and their fused basement membranes.
31. **Tidal volume** (TV) is the volume of air inhaled or exhaled during a normal, quiet breath. It is typically around 500 mL in adults and is measured using a spirometer.
32. **Vital capacity** (VC) is the maximum volume of air that can be exhaled after a maximal inspiration. It is measured by a spirometer and represents the total usable lung volume.
33. **Residual volume** (RV) is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a maximal exhalation. It cannot be exhaled and ensures that the lungs are never completely empty, preventing alveolar collapse.
34. **Functional residual capacity** (FRC) is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a normal exhalation. It is the sum of expiratory reserve volume (ERV) and residual volume (RV).
35. **Minute ventilation** is the total volume of air inhaled or exhaled per minute. It is calculated by multiplying the tidal volume (TV) by the respiratory rate (breaths per minute).
36. The **respiratory quotient** (RQ) is the ratio of carbon dioxide produced to oxygen consumed (CO2 produced / O2 consumed) during respiration. It indicates the type of fuel being metabolized (e.g., 1.0 for carbohydrates).
37. **Oxygen debt** is the extra amount of oxygen required by the body after strenuous exercise to oxidize accumulated lactic acid and restore ATP and creatine phosphate stores. It occurs due to anaerobic respiration during intense activity.
38. During **acclimatization to high altitude**, the body undergoes several physiological changes to cope with reduced oxygen. These include increased breathing rate, increased heart rate, and over time, increased production of red blood cells to carry more oxygen.
39. **Mountain sickness** is a condition caused by rapid ascent to high altitudes where oxygen levels are lower. Symptoms include headache, nausea, dizziness, and shortness of breath, due to the body's struggle to adapt to hypoxia.
40. **Cyanosis** is a bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes. It occurs when there is a significantly reduced amount of oxygenated hemoglobin in the blood, indicating inadequate oxygen supply to tissues.
41. **Pneumothorax** is the presence of air in the pleural cavity, the space between the lung and the chest wall. This can cause the lung to collapse, leading to severe breathing difficulties.
42. **Emphysema** is a chronic lung disease characterized by the destruction of the walls of the alveoli. This reduces the surface area for gas exchange, leading to severe shortness of breath and impaired oxygen uptake.
43. **Asthma** is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by episodes of bronchoconstriction (narrowing of airways), leading to wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and difficulty breathing.
44. **Pneumonia** is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs, which may fill with fluid or pus. This impairs gas exchange, leading to coughing, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing.
45. **Tuberculosis** (TB) is a bacterial infection that primarily affects the lungs. It can cause chronic cough, fever, weight loss, and can severely damage lung tissue, impairing respiratory function.
46. **COPD** (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) is a group of progressive lung diseases that block airflow and make it difficult to breathe. It includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis, characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms.
47. **Pulmonary edema** is a condition caused by excess fluid in the lungs. This fluid collects in the numerous air sacs in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe and severely impairing gas exchange.
48. **Atelectasis** is the partial or complete collapse of a lung or a lobe of a lung. It occurs when the alveoli within the lung become deflated or filled with fluid, often due to airway obstruction or pressure from outside the lung.
49. **Pulmonary embolism** is a blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries in the lungs, usually caused by a blood clot that travels from the legs. It can severely impair blood flow to the lungs and gas exchange, leading to sudden shortness of breath and chest pain.
50. **Respiratory distress syndrome** (RDS) is a breathing disorder of newborns, most often premature infants. It is caused by insufficient production of surfactant, leading to alveolar collapse and severe difficulty breathing.
51. Abnormal breathing patterns include **dyspnea** (difficulty breathing), **tachypnea** (rapid breathing), **bradypnea** (slow breathing), **apnea** (absence of breathing), **Kussmaul breathing** (deep, rapid), and **Cheyne-Stokes breathing** (periodic waxing and waning).
52. **Dyspnea** is the subjective sensation of difficulty or labored breathing, often described as "shortness of breath." Common causes include lung diseases (asthma, COPD), heart conditions, and anxiety.
53. **Orthopnea** is difficulty breathing that occurs when lying flat. It is relieved by sitting or standing up. It is often a symptom of heart failure or severe lung disease, where fluid accumulates in the lungs when supine.
54. **Kussmaul breathing** is a deep, rapid, and labored breathing pattern. It is a compensatory mechanism seen in severe metabolic acidosis, particularly **diabetic ketoacidosis**, where the body tries to expel excess CO2 to raise blood pH.
55. **Cheyne-Stokes breathing** is an abnormal pattern of breathing characterized by progressively deeper, and sometimes faster, breathing followed by a gradual decrease that results in a temporary stop in breathing (apnea). It is often seen in heart failure, stroke, or brain injury.
56. The **Valsalva maneuver** involves exhaling forcefully against a closed airway (e.g., holding breath and bearing down). It increases intrathoracic pressure, affecting blood flow and heart rate, and is used in activities like lifting heavy weights.
57. **Respiratory alkalosis** is a condition characterized by a high blood pH (alkaline) due to a decrease in blood CO2 levels. It is typically caused by **hyperventilation**, where excessive breathing expels too much CO2.
58. **Hypercapnia** is a condition of abnormally elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the blood. It can lead to respiratory acidosis, confusion, and drowsiness, as CO2 acts as a potent vasodilator and respiratory stimulant.
59. **Hyperventilation** is rapid or deep breathing that causes the body to expel too much carbon dioxide. This leads to a decrease in blood CO2 levels, which can result in respiratory alkalosis, dizziness, and tingling sensations.
60. The **pleura** are two thin membranes that surround the lungs and line the chest cavity. They create a fluid-filled space that allows the lungs to glide smoothly against the chest wall during breathing, reducing friction.
61. **Pleurisy** is an inflammation of the pleura, the membranes surrounding the lungs. It causes sharp chest pain that worsens with breathing, coughing, or sneezing, due to the inflamed pleural surfaces rubbing against each other.
62. The **respiratory pump** refers to the action of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles during breathing, which creates pressure changes in the thoracic cavity. These pressure changes assist in venous return, helping blood flow back to the heart.
63. **Normal lung sounds** are typically clear and quiet. **Bronchial sounds** are loud and harsh over the trachea. **Vesicular sounds** are soft and rustling over most of the lung fields.
64. **Abnormal lung sounds** indicate underlying respiratory issues. Examples include **wheezes** (high-pitched whistling), **rales/crackles** (discontinuous popping), and **rhonchi** (low-pitched rumbling). Their significance helps diagnose conditions like asthma, pneumonia, or bronchitis.
65. **Stridor** is a harsh, high-pitched, crowing sound heard during inspiration. It indicates an obstruction in the upper airway, such as the larynx or trachea, and is a sign of a medical emergency.
66. **Wheeze** is a high-pitched, whistling sound produced by air flowing through narrowed airways. It is commonly caused by bronchoconstriction, as seen in asthma, or by secretions in the airways.
67. **Rales** (also called crackles) are discontinuous, popping, or crackling sounds heard during inspiration. They are caused by the opening of small airways or alveoli that were previously collapsed or filled with fluid.
68. **Rhonchi** are low-pitched, continuous, rumbling sounds heard during breathing. They are caused by air passing through larger airways that are narrowed by secretions or mucus, often cleared by coughing.
69. A **friction rub** is a grating or creaking sound heard during both inspiration and expiration. It is caused by the inflamed pleural surfaces rubbing against each other, indicating pleurisy.
70. **Consolidation** refers to a region of lung tissue that has become filled with fluid, pus, or blood, making it solid instead of air-filled. It is detected by dullness on percussion and increased tactile fremitus.
71. **Bronchophony** is an abnormal increase in the clarity and loudness of spoken words heard through the stethoscope over the lungs. It indicates lung consolidation, where sound travels more efficiently through solid tissue.
72. **Egophony** is a specific type of bronchophony where the spoken "E" sound heard through the stethoscope sounds like "A." It indicates lung consolidation, often seen in pneumonia.
73. **Tactile fremitus** is the vibration felt on the chest wall when a patient speaks. It is normally present but can be increased over areas of lung consolidation (e.g., pneumonia) or decreased over areas with air or fluid (e.g., pneumothorax, pleural effusion).
74. **Dullness on percussion** is a thud-like sound heard when tapping the chest wall. It indicates the presence of fluid or solid tissue in the lung, such as in pneumonia, pleural effusion, or tumors.
75. **Hyperresonance** is a booming, drum-like sound heard on percussion of the chest. It indicates an abnormally increased amount of air in the lungs, as seen in emphysema or pneumothorax.
76. **Hemoptysis** is the coughing up of blood or blood-stained mucus from the respiratory tract. It can be caused by various conditions, including bronchitis, lung infections, or lung cancer.
77. **Laryngospasm** is a sudden, involuntary spasm of the vocal cords that temporarily closes the airway. It can be life-threatening and requires immediate management to restore breathing.
78. **Anatomical dead space** is the volume of the conducting airways (nose, pharynx, trachea, bronchi) where no gas exchange occurs. **Physiological dead space** includes anatomical dead space plus the volume of any non-functional alveoli.
79. Factors affecting **oxygen-hemoglobin binding** include pH (Bohr effect), CO2 levels, temperature, and the concentration of 2,3-DPG. Changes in these factors shift the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve.
80. The **respiratory quotient** (RQ) indicates the type of fuel being metabolized by the body. An RQ of 1.0 suggests carbohydrate metabolism, while lower values indicate fat or protein metabolism.
81. **Adaptation mechanisms at high altitude** include increased breathing rate and depth, increased heart rate, and over several days to weeks, increased production of red blood cells to enhance oxygen-carrying capacity.
82. During **exercise**, breathing rate and depth increase significantly to meet the higher oxygen demand and remove increased CO2. This is regulated by neural and chemical signals.
83. An increase in **temperature** shifts the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the right, meaning hemoglobin releases oxygen more readily to tissues. This is beneficial in active, warmer muscles.
84. A decrease in **pH** (increased acidity) shifts the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the right (Bohr effect), promoting oxygen release from hemoglobin to tissues.
85. **CO2 narcosis** is a state of unconsciousness or stupor caused by very high levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. It occurs when the respiratory drive is suppressed, often in patients with chronic lung disease.
86. **Sleep apnea** is a sleep disorder characterized by repeated pauses in breathing during sleep. Types include obstructive sleep apnea (airway blockage) and central sleep apnea (brain fails to send signals to breathe).
87. The **diving reflex** is a set of physiological responses triggered by facial immersion in cold water. It includes bradycardia (slowed heart rate), peripheral vasoconstriction, and a shift of blood to vital organs, conserving oxygen.
88. **Artificial respiration** is a method of providing breathing support to someone who has stopped breathing or is breathing inadequately. It can involve mouth-to-mouth resuscitation or mechanical devices.
89. **Mechanical ventilation** is a life support treatment that uses a machine (ventilator) to help a patient breathe. It is used when a patient cannot breathe adequately on their own, such as in severe respiratory failure.
90. **Smoking** severely damages the respiratory system, leading to chronic bronchitis, emphysema (COPD), and lung cancer. It impairs ciliary function, causes inflammation, and destroys alveolar walls.
91. **Occupational lung diseases** are respiratory conditions caused by exposure to harmful substances in the workplace, such as asbestos (asbestosis), silica (silicosis), or coal dust (coal worker's pneumoconiosis).
92. **Mucus** in the respiratory tract traps inhaled particles, dust, and microorganisms. It forms a protective layer that prevents these foreign substances from reaching the lungs.
93. **Cilia** are tiny, hair-like projections lining the respiratory airways. They rhythmically beat to move the mucus layer, along with trapped particles, upwards towards the pharynx to be swallowed or expelled, a process called mucociliary clearance.
94. The **immune functions of the respiratory system** include mucociliary clearance, the presence of macrophages in the alveoli that engulf pathogens, and the secretion of immunoglobulins (antibodies) in the mucus.
95. The **heart and lungs** work together in a close relationship. The heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs for oxygenation, and then pumps the oxygenated blood to the rest of the body, ensuring continuous oxygen supply to tissues.
96. **Age-related changes in the respiratory system** include decreased lung elasticity, weakening of respiratory muscles, reduced vital capacity, and a less efficient immune response, making older adults more susceptible to respiratory infections.
97. **Gender differences in respiratory function** exist, with males generally having larger lung volumes and capacities than females, even when adjusted for body size. This can influence athletic performance and susceptibility to certain lung diseases.
98. **Nitric oxide** (NO) is a gas produced in the respiratory tract. It acts as a vasodilator, relaxing smooth muscles in the airways and blood vessels, and also has antimicrobial properties, contributing to lung defense.
99. **Respiratory responses to stress** involve an increase in breathing rate and depth, mediated by the sympathetic nervous system. This prepares the body for "fight or flight" by increasing oxygen intake and CO2 removal.
100. **Respiratory rehabilitation** is a program of education and exercise designed to help people with chronic lung diseases breathe easier and improve their quality of life. It includes breathing techniques, physical training, and nutritional counseling.

## Section D: Three Mark Questions

1.  Oxygen enters through the **nose** (or mouth), passes through the **pharynx**, **larynx**, and down the **trachea**. The trachea branches into two **bronchi**, which further divide into smaller bronchioles, leading to the **alveoli** in the lungs. At the alveoli, gas exchange occurs: oxygen diffuses across the thin alveolar and capillary walls into the bloodstream, where it binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells. The oxygenated blood is then transported by the circulatory system to the **tissue cells**, where oxygen diffuses from the blood into the cells for cellular respiration.
2.  **Breathing** is the process of moving air into (inspiration) and out of (expiration) the lungs. During **inspiration**, the **diaphragm contracts and flattens**, moving downwards, while the **external intercostal muscles contract**, pulling the rib cage upwards and outwards. These actions increase the volume of the thoracic cavity, causing a decrease in intra-pulmonary pressure below atmospheric pressure, which draws air into the lungs. During **expiration**, these muscles **relax**. The diaphragm moves upwards, and the rib cage moves downwards and inwards due to elastic recoil of the lungs and chest wall. This decreases the thoracic volume, increasing intra-pulmonary pressure above atmospheric pressure, forcing air out of the lungs.
3.  **Aerobic respiration** occurs in the presence of oxygen, primarily in the mitochondria of cells. It completely breaks down glucose to produce a large amount of energy (ATP), along with carbon dioxide and water as byproducts. In both plants and humans, this is the most efficient form of energy production. **Anaerobic respiration** occurs in the absence of oxygen. In plants (e.g., yeast), it produces ethanol and carbon dioxide with a small amount of ATP. In humans (e.g., muscle cells during intense exercise), it produces lactic acid and a small amount of ATP, leading to muscle fatigue.
4.  The **nose** filters, warms, and moistens incoming air. The **pharynx** is a common passageway for air and food. The **larynx** (voice box) contains vocal cords for sound production and the epiglottis to prevent food from entering the airway. The **trachea** (windpipe) is a cartilaginous tube providing a clear airway. It branches into two **bronchi**, which further divide into smaller bronchioles, leading to the **lungs**. Within the lungs, tiny air sacs called **alveoli** are the primary sites of gas exchange. Their thin walls and large surface area facilitate efficient diffusion of oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out of the blood.
5.  **Oxygen transport:** Oxygen primarily binds reversibly to the iron in **hemoglobin** molecules within red blood cells, forming oxyhemoglobin (about 97%). A small amount (about 3%) is dissolved directly in the plasma. **Carbon dioxide transport:** CO2 is transported in three main ways: about 70% as **bicarbonate ions** (HCO3-) in the plasma (formed in red blood cells by carbonic anhydrase), about 23% bound to hemoglobin as carbaminohemoglobin, and about 7% dissolved directly in the plasma.
6.  **Neural control of breathing** is primarily regulated by the **respiratory centers** located in the **medulla oblongata** and **pons** of the brainstem, which generate the basic breathing rhythm. **Chemoreceptors** play a crucial role: central chemoreceptors in the medulla are highly sensitive to changes in blood CO2 and pH, while peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid and aortic bodies monitor O2, CO2, and pH. These chemoreceptors send feedback signals to the respiratory centers, which then adjust the rate and depth of breathing to maintain blood gas homeostasis.
7.  **Respiratory volumes** are measurements of air moved during breathing, while **capacities** are combinations of two or more volumes. Key volumes include **Tidal Volume** (normal breath, ~500mL), **Inspiratory Reserve Volume** (max inhale beyond TV), **Expiratory Reserve Volume** (max exhale beyond TV), and **Residual Volume** (air remaining after max exhale). Capacities include **Vital Capacity** (max inhale to max exhale, VC = TV + IRV + ERV) and **Total Lung Capacity** (all air in lungs after max inhale, TLC = VC + RV). These are measured by spirometry and are clinically significant for diagnosing lung diseases and assessing respiratory function. Factors like age, gender, height, and disease affect them.
8.  **Acclimatization to high altitude** involves several physiological adaptations to compensate for reduced atmospheric oxygen. Initially, there's an immediate increase in **breathing rate and depth** (hyperventilation) and **heart rate** to maximize oxygen intake and delivery. Over days to weeks, the kidneys release erythropoietin, stimulating the bone marrow to produce more **red blood cells**, increasing the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity. Additionally, the production of 2,3-DPG in red blood cells increases, which shifts the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the right, facilitating oxygen release to tissues.
9.  **Asphyxiation** is a severe condition resulting from extreme oxygen deprivation, often due to airway obstruction or suffocation. It leads to a rapid buildup of CO2 and a sharp drop in O2, causing unconsciousness, organ damage, and potentially death. **Hypoxia** is a broader term for inadequate oxygen supply at the tissue level. Causes include low atmospheric O2 (altitude), impaired lung function (pneumonia), reduced blood flow (heart failure), or impaired cellular oxygen utilization (poisoning). Symptoms vary from shortness of breath and dizziness to confusion and cyanosis. The body's compensatory mechanisms include increased breathing and heart rate, and increased red blood cell production in chronic cases.
10. The **oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve** plots the percentage of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen against the partial pressure of oxygen. It is typically S-shaped, indicating that hemoglobin readily picks up oxygen in the lungs and releases it efficiently in tissues. Factors that shift the curve to the right (meaning hemoglobin releases oxygen more easily) include increased CO2 (Bohr effect), decreased pH (acidity), increased temperature, and increased 2,3-DPG. These shifts are physiologically significant as they ensure oxygen is delivered precisely where it is most needed, such as in metabolically active, warmer, and more acidic tissues.
11. **Carbon dioxide transport** in the blood is highly efficient. Approximately 70% of CO2 is transported as **bicarbonate ions (HCO3-)**. CO2 diffuses into red blood cells, where the enzyme **carbonic anhydrase** rapidly catalyzes its reaction with water to form carbonic acid (H2CO3). Carbonic acid then dissociates into H+ and HCO3-. The HCO3- ions diffuse out into the plasma, and to maintain electrical neutrality, chloride ions (Cl-) move into the red blood cells, a process known as the **chloride shift**. About 23% of CO2 binds to hemoglobin (forming carbaminohemoglobin), and 7% dissolves directly in plasma.
12. **Alveoli** are microscopic air sacs in the lungs, numbering millions, which are the primary sites of gas exchange. Each alveolus is surrounded by a dense capillary network. Their structure is optimized for diffusion: they have extremely thin walls (one cell thick), a large total surface area, and are coated with **surfactant**. Surfactant reduces the surface tension of the alveolar fluid, preventing the alveoli from collapsing during exhalation. This efficient structure allows for rapid and effective diffusion of oxygen from the inhaled air into the blood and carbon dioxide from the blood into the alveoli to be exhaled.
13. **Dead space** refers to the volume of air within the respiratory system that does not participate in gas exchange. **Anatomical dead space** is the volume of the conducting airways (nose, pharynx, trachea, bronchi) where no gas exchange occurs, typically around 150 mL. **Physiological dead space** includes the anatomical dead space plus any alveolar volume that is not participating in gas exchange due to inadequate blood flow (e.g., in emphysema or pulmonary embolism). Clinically, an increase in physiological dead space indicates inefficient gas exchange and can lead to respiratory failure, as more air is breathed but not effectively used for oxygenation.
14. **Pneumonia** is an infection that inflames the air sacs, often filling them with fluid or pus, impairing gas exchange. **Tuberculosis (TB)** is a bacterial infection, usually of the lungs, causing chronic inflammation and tissue destruction, leading to impaired gas exchange and reduced lung capacity. **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**, encompassing emphysema (alveolar destruction) and chronic bronchitis (airway inflammation), causes irreversible airflow limitation. All three significantly reduce the efficiency of gas exchange, leading to shortness of breath, cough, and reduced oxygenation of the blood.
15. During **exercise**, the body's metabolic rate increases significantly, leading to a higher demand for oxygen and increased production of carbon dioxide. To meet these demands, **ventilation** (breathing rate and depth) increases dramatically, often by 10-20 times the resting rate. This ensures a greater supply of oxygen to the working muscles and efficient removal of excess CO2. The increased CO2 and lactic acid (from anaerobic respiration) lower blood pH, stimulating chemoreceptors, which in turn signal the respiratory centers in the brain to further increase breathing, maintaining blood gas homeostasis.
16. The **respiratory system** begins to develop early in embryonic life. The lungs originate as an outgrowth of the foregut. Throughout fetal development, the lungs undergo extensive branching and maturation, but they are filled with fluid and do not perform gas exchange. Fetal breathing movements occur, which are important for lung development. At **birth**, the first breath is a powerful inspiration that inflates the lungs, clearing the fluid. Surfactant production becomes adequate, preventing alveolar collapse. The circulatory system also undergoes significant changes, diverting blood flow to the lungs for the first time, establishing independent respiration.
17. Various **environmental factors** can significantly impact the respiratory system. **Air pollution** (e.g., particulate matter, ozone) can cause inflammation, reduce lung function, and exacerbate conditions like asthma and COPD. **Smoking** is a major cause of lung diseases, including emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and lung cancer, by damaging airways and alveoli. **Occupational hazards** like exposure to asbestos, silica, or coal dust can lead to specific lung diseases (e.g., asbestosis, silicosis, pneumoconiosis) due to chronic inflammation and scarring of lung tissue. These factors impair gas exchange, reduce lung elasticity, and increase susceptibility to infections.
18. The **respiratory and cardiovascular systems** are intimately linked and work in tandem to ensure adequate tissue oxygenation. The **respiratory system** is responsible for gas exchange, bringing oxygen into the body and expelling carbon dioxide. The **cardiovascular system** (heart and blood vessels) then transports this oxygenated blood from the lungs to all body tissues and carries deoxygenated blood and CO2 back to the lungs. The heart's pumping action drives blood through the pulmonary circulation for gas exchange and then through the systemic circulation to deliver oxygen. Any dysfunction in one system directly impacts the other, leading to conditions like hypoxemia or heart failure.
19. The **respiratory system** plays a crucial role in maintaining the body's **acid-base balance**, primarily by regulating carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, which directly influence blood pH. CO2 combines with water to form carbonic acid (H2CO3), a weak acid. When blood pH drops (acidosis), the respiratory system compensates by increasing breathing rate and depth (hyperventilation) to expel more CO2, thereby reducing blood acidity. Conversely, if blood pH rises (alkalosis), breathing slows down (hypoventilation) to retain CO2, increasing blood acidity. This rapid respiratory compensation mechanism is vital for buffering metabolic acid-base disturbances.
20. **Abnormal breathing patterns** often indicate underlying medical conditions. **Cheyne-Stokes breathing** is characterized by a waxing and waning depth of breathing, with periods of apnea, often seen in heart failure or neurological damage. **Kussmaul breathing** is deep, rapid, and labored, a compensatory hyperventilation in severe metabolic acidosis (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis) to blow off CO2. **Biot's breathing** is characterized by irregular periods of apnea alternating with periods of uniform deep breaths, often associated with damage to the pons due to stroke or trauma. These patterns provide important diagnostic clues.
21. **Respiratory failure** is a life-threatening condition where the respiratory system fails to adequately oxygenate the blood or remove carbon dioxide. It has two main types: **Hypoxemic respiratory failure** (Type I) is characterized by low blood oxygen (PaO2 < 60 mmHg) despite normal or low CO2, often due to impaired gas exchange (e.g., pneumonia, ARDS). **Hypercapnic respiratory failure** (Type II) is characterized by high blood CO2 (PaCO2 > 50 mmHg) and often low oxygen, due to inadequate ventilation (e.g., COPD exacerbation, neuromuscular disorders). Both types lead to impaired tissue oxygenation and can result in organ dysfunction if not treated promptly.
22. The **cough reflex** is a vital protective mechanism of the respiratory system. It is a rapid, forceful expulsion of air from the lungs, designed to clear irritants, foreign particles, or excessive secretions from the airways. The reflex involves sensory receptors in the airways, a cough center in the medulla, and efferent nerves to respiratory muscles. In respiratory diseases, a **persistent cough** can be a prominent symptom, often indicating chronic inflammation (e.g., chronic bronchitis), airway irritation (e.g., asthma), or the presence of excess mucus or foreign bodies. While protective, a chronic cough can also be debilitating and impact quality of life.
23. **Diving physiology** involves understanding the body's responses to increased pressure underwater. **Breath-holding mechanisms** are crucial, as divers must manage their oxygen stores and CO2 buildup. As pressure increases, gases dissolve more readily in blood and tissues. **Decompression sickness** (DCS), or "the bends," occurs when a diver ascends too quickly, causing dissolved nitrogen to form bubbles in the blood and tissues, leading to pain, neurological symptoms, or even death. Prevention involves slow, controlled ascent rates and decompression stops to allow nitrogen to safely off-gas.
24. The body responds differently to various types of **hypoxia**. **Hypoxic hypoxia** (low PaO2) is due to insufficient oxygen in the air (altitude) or impaired lung function; the body adapts by increasing ventilation and RBC production. **Anemic hypoxia** (reduced O2-carrying capacity) is due to low hemoglobin (anemia) or CO poisoning; adaptation involves increased cardiac output. **Circulatory hypoxia** (reduced blood flow) is due to heart failure or shock; adaptation involves peripheral vasoconstriction. **Histotoxic hypoxia** (impaired O2 utilization) is due to cellular poisons (e.g., cyanide); there are limited physiological adaptations, making it highly dangerous.
25. The **pharmacology of the respiratory system** involves drugs that target various aspects of lung function. **Bronchodilators** (e.g., beta-agonists, anticholinergics) relax the smooth muscles around the airways, widening them to improve airflow, commonly used in asthma and COPD. **Anti-inflammatory drugs** (e.g., corticosteroids) reduce inflammation in the airways, decreasing swelling and mucus production, also crucial for chronic respiratory conditions. Other drugs include mucolytics (thin mucus), expectorants (aid mucus expulsion), and antitussives (suppress cough). These medications aim to alleviate symptoms, improve lung function, and prevent exacerbations.
26. **Sleep-related breathing disorders** are conditions characterized by abnormal breathing patterns during sleep. The most common is **Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)**, where the airway repeatedly collapses during sleep, leading to pauses in breathing and loud snoring. **Central Sleep Apnea (CSA)** occurs when the brain fails to send proper signals to the muscles that control breathing. Both types cause fragmented sleep, daytime sleepiness, and can lead to serious health consequences like hypertension, heart disease, and stroke due to intermittent hypoxia and sleep disruption. Diagnosis involves sleep studies, and treatment ranges from lifestyle changes to CPAP therapy or surgery.
27. The **respiratory system** is fundamental to **speech production**. Speech requires a controlled outflow of air from the lungs. During phonation, the **diaphragm** and **intercostal muscles** provide the necessary air pressure and flow. Air passes through the **larynx**, where the **vocal cords** vibrate to produce sound. The pitch and volume of the voice are controlled by the tension and vibration of these cords. Finally, the sound is articulated into recognizable speech by the precise movements of the **pharynx, tongue, soft palate, teeth, and lips**. Coordination between breathing and these articulators is essential for fluent and intelligible speech.
28. The **respiratory system** possesses robust **immune functions** to defend against inhaled pathogens and irritants. The **mucociliary escalator** (mucus layer trapped by cilia) continuously sweeps foreign particles upwards for expulsion. **Alveolar macrophages** are phagocytic cells in the alveoli that engulf and destroy inhaled microorganisms. The respiratory tract also secretes **immunoglobulins** (antibodies), particularly IgA, into the mucus, providing specific immune defense. These mechanisms collectively form a critical first line of defense, preventing infections and maintaining lung health.
29. Beyond its primary role in gas exchange, the **lungs** perform several important **metabolic functions**. They are involved in the **metabolism of various drugs**, acting as a site for enzymatic breakdown or activation. The lungs also play a role in the production and inactivation of certain **hormones** and vasoactive substances, such as converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Furthermore, the extensive capillary network in the lungs acts as a **blood filter**, trapping small clots or emboli before they can reach the systemic circulation, thus protecting other organs.
30. The **respiratory system** undergoes significant changes with **aging**, leading to a gradual decline in function. Structural changes include decreased elasticity of the lung tissue and chest wall, leading to reduced compliance. The respiratory muscles may weaken, and the number of functional alveoli can decrease. Functionally, there is a reduction in lung volumes (e.g., vital capacity) and gas exchange efficiency. These changes make older adults more susceptible to respiratory infections, reduce their exercise tolerance, and can exacerbate pre-existing lung conditions, increasing their overall disease susceptibility.
31. The **respiratory system** can be significantly affected by **systemic diseases**. In **diabetes**, poor glycemic control can lead to impaired lung function and increased susceptibility to infections. **Kidney disease** can cause fluid overload, leading to pulmonary edema, and metabolic acidosis, which triggers compensatory hyperventilation. **Heart failure** often results in pulmonary congestion and edema, causing dyspnea and orthopnea. Management strategies involve treating the underlying systemic disease, optimizing fluid balance, and providing respiratory support as needed, such as diuretics for edema or oxygen therapy.
32. **Pulmonary function tests (PFTs)** are a group of diagnostic tests that measure how well the lungs are working. **Spirometry** is the most common PFT, measuring forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) to assess airflow limitation (e.g., in asthma, COPD). **Gas diffusion studies** (e.g., DLCO) measure the efficiency of gas transfer across the alveolar-capillary membrane. **Exercise testing** assesses lung function during physical exertion. These tests are crucial for diagnosing respiratory diseases, monitoring disease progression, evaluating treatment effectiveness, and assessing surgical risk.
33. **Pulmonary edema** is a condition characterized by excess fluid accumulation in the lungs, specifically in the interstitial spaces and alveoli, severely impairing gas exchange. **Cardiogenic pulmonary edema** is caused by left-sided heart failure, leading to increased pressure in the pulmonary capillaries, forcing fluid into the lungs. **Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema** (e.g., ARDS) is caused by direct lung injury or systemic inflammation, increasing capillary permeability. The consequences include severe dyspnea, hypoxemia, and can be life-threatening. Treatment differs based on the cause, targeting either cardiac function or lung inflammation.
34. **Mechanical ventilation** is a life-sustaining treatment that uses a machine (ventilator) to assist or replace spontaneous breathing. The **principles** involve delivering a controlled volume or pressure of air to the lungs, maintaining adequate oxygenation and CO2 removal. **Types of ventilators** include positive pressure ventilators (most common), which push air into the lungs, and negative pressure ventilators. It is used in cases of respiratory failure, severe lung injury, or during surgery. The **physiological principles** involve manipulating airway pressure, lung volumes, and respiratory rate to support gas exchange and reduce the work of breathing, while minimizing lung injury.
35. **Space physiology** presents unique challenges for the respiratory system. In **microgravity**, the distribution of blood and air in the lungs changes, affecting ventilation-perfusion matching. **Altered atmospheric pressure** (e.g., in spacecraft or during EVA) requires careful management to prevent decompression sickness or hypoxia. **Oxygen supply challenges** involve ensuring a reliable source of breathable air and managing CO2 removal in a closed environment. Astronauts may experience reduced lung volumes and altered respiratory muscle function. Research in space physiology aims to understand these changes and develop countermeasures for long-duration space missions.
36. **Occupational lung diseases** are respiratory conditions caused by prolonged or intense exposure to harmful substances in the workplace. **Causes** include inhalation of dusts (e.g., silica leading to silicosis, asbestos leading to asbestosis), chemicals (e.g., isocyanates causing occupational asthma), or biological agents. The **pathophysiology** often involves chronic inflammation, fibrosis, or allergic reactions in the lungs. **Prevention strategies** include engineering controls (ventilation), administrative controls (work practices), and personal protective equipment (respirators). **Legal aspects** involve workers' compensation and regulations to ensure workplace safety and health.
37. The **genetics of respiratory diseases** highlights the role of inherited factors in susceptibility and progression. For example, **Cystic Fibrosis (CF)** is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, leading to thick, sticky mucus that obstructs airways and causes chronic lung infections. **Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD)** is an inherited condition where a deficiency of the AAT protein (a protease inhibitor) leads to early-onset emphysema, as proteases are unchecked and damage lung tissue. Understanding these genetic bases is crucial for diagnosis, genetic counseling, and developing targeted therapies.
38. **Respiratory pharmacokinetics** describes how drugs are absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated when administered via the respiratory route. **Drug absorption through the lungs** is rapid due to the large surface area and rich blood supply of the alveoli, making it an effective route for systemic delivery (e.g., insulin via inhalation). However, most respiratory drugs are intended for **local effects** (e.g., bronchodilators for asthma), minimizing systemic side effects. Factors like particle size, solubility, and patient breathing patterns influence drug deposition and absorption, impacting the **local vs systemic effects** of inhaled medications.
39. **Nitric oxide (NO)** plays multiple crucial roles in **respiratory physiology**. It acts as a potent **vasodilator**, relaxing the smooth muscles in the pulmonary blood vessels, which helps to optimize blood flow to well-ventilated areas of the lungs, improving ventilation-perfusion matching. NO also has **antimicrobial effects**, contributing to the innate immune defense of the respiratory tract. In **therapeutic applications**, inhaled NO is used in conditions like persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn to selectively dilate pulmonary arteries and improve oxygenation, demonstrating its significant clinical utility.
40. The **respiratory system** exhibits remarkable **responses to extreme environments**. In **high altitude** (hypoxia), breathing rate and depth increase, and over time, RBC production rises. In **underwater** environments (hyperbaric conditions), increased pressure affects gas solubility, leading to concerns like nitrogen narcosis and decompression sickness. In **extreme cold**, the respiratory tract warms and humidifies inhaled air, but prolonged exposure can lead to bronchoconstriction. In **extreme heat**, increased breathing helps dissipate heat. These responses are vital for survival and involve complex physiological adaptations to maintain gas exchange and body temperature.
41. The **molecular mechanisms of gas exchange** are governed by physical principles. **Diffusion laws** (e.g., Fick's Law) state that the rate of gas diffusion across a membrane is directly proportional to the surface area and the partial pressure gradient, and inversely proportional to the thickness of the membrane. The **respiratory membrane** (alveolar and capillary walls) is extremely thin and has a vast surface area, optimizing diffusion. **Membrane permeability** to gases is also crucial. Factors affecting **gas solubility** (e.g., CO2 is much more soluble than O2) influence how readily gases dissolve in blood and are transported.
42. The **embryological development of the respiratory system** begins early in gestation as an outgrowth of the foregut. It involves extensive branching (trachea, bronchi, bronchioles) and differentiation of various cell types (e.g., alveolar cells, ciliated cells). **Critical periods** exist where disruptions can lead to severe developmental anomalies, such as tracheoesophageal fistula or lung hypoplasia. At birth, the lungs must transition from a fluid-filled state to air-filled, requiring adequate surfactant production. Understanding this development is crucial for diagnosing and managing congenital respiratory disorders and for understanding the impact of prenatal insults.
43. **Allergic diseases** like **asthma** involve the respiratory system's immune response. In asthma, exposure to allergens (e.g., pollen, dust mites) triggers an immune reaction in sensitized individuals. This involves **allergen recognition** by immune cells, leading to the release of inflammatory mediators (e.g., histamine, leukotrienes). These mediators cause **inflammatory cascades** in the airways, resulting in bronchoconstriction, mucus hypersecretion, and airway edema, leading to the characteristic symptoms of wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. Management involves avoiding triggers and using bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory medications.
44. The **mechanical properties of the lungs and chest wall** are crucial for efficient breathing. **Compliance** refers to the ease with which the lungs and chest wall can be stretched or distended (volume change per unit pressure change). High compliance means easy inflation, while low compliance (e.g., in fibrosis) makes breathing harder. **Elastance** is the reciprocal of compliance, representing the tendency to recoil. The **work of breathing** is the energy expended to overcome elastic and non-elastic (airway resistance) forces during ventilation. These properties are assessed using pressure-volume curves and are vital for understanding respiratory mechanics and disease.
45. **Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) relationships** describe the matching between the amount of air reaching the alveoli (ventilation, V) and the amount of blood flowing through the pulmonary capillaries (perfusion, Q). Ideally, V/Q should be close to 1.0 for optimal gas exchange. **Regional differences** exist, with V/Q being higher at the apex and lower at the base of the lungs in upright posture. **Mismatching effects** (V/Q mismatch) occur when ventilation or perfusion is impaired, leading to inefficient gas exchange. This is a common cause of hypoxemia in lung diseases (e.g., V/Q > 1.0 in embolism, V/Q < 1.0 in pneumonia). Clinical assessment involves V/Q scans.
46. In **critical care medicine**, the respiratory system is often a primary focus. **ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome)** is a severe form of acute lung injury characterized by widespread inflammation, leading to fluid accumulation in alveoli and severe hypoxemia. **Ventilator-associated complications** include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). **Weaning strategies** involve gradually reducing ventilator support to allow the patient to resume spontaneous breathing. Critical care management aims to optimize oxygenation, minimize lung injury, and support recovery in severely ill patients.
47. **Environmental respiratory health** examines the impact of external factors on the respiratory system. **Air quality effects** from pollutants (e.g., particulate matter, ozone, sulfur dioxide) can cause inflammation, exacerbate asthma, and increase the risk of lung cancer. **Climate change impacts** include increased allergens (pollen), more frequent wildfires (smoke), and altered distribution of infectious agents. **Public health interventions** involve monitoring air quality, implementing emission controls, promoting clean energy, and educating the public on protective measures to mitigate the adverse effects of environmental factors on respiratory health.
48. **Respiratory rehabilitation** is a comprehensive program designed to improve the well-being of individuals with chronic respiratory diseases (e.g., COPD, asthma, cystic fibrosis). Its **principles** include individualized exercise training (aerobic, strength, flexibility) to improve physical endurance and reduce dyspnea. **Breathing techniques** (e.g., pursed-lip breathing, diaphragmatic breathing) are taught to optimize ventilation. **Patient education programs** cover disease management, medication adherence, nutrition, and coping strategies. The goal is to reduce symptoms, improve exercise capacity, enhance quality of life, and decrease hospitalizations.
49. **Respiratory biomarkers** are measurable indicators that reflect physiological or pathological processes in the respiratory system, aiding in diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring. **Inflammatory markers** (e.g., C-reactive protein, sputum eosinophils) indicate airway inflammation. **Gas exchange indicators** (e.g., blood gas analysis, exhaled nitric oxide) assess lung function. Other biomarkers include specific proteins (e.g., surfactant protein D), genetic markers, and imaging findings. These biomarkers provide objective data for disease monitoring, guiding treatment decisions, and identifying patients at risk for exacerbations or disease progression.
50. **Future directions in respiratory medicine** are rapidly evolving. **Gene therapy** holds promise for treating genetic lung diseases like cystic fibrosis by correcting the underlying genetic defect. **Regenerative medicine** aims to repair or replace damaged lung tissue using stem cells or bioengineered organs. **Personalized treatment approaches** involve tailoring therapies based on an individual's genetic makeup, biomarker profile, and disease phenotype, moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach. Other areas include advanced imaging, novel drug delivery systems, and artificial intelligence for diagnosis and treatment optimization, promising significant advancements in patient care.
