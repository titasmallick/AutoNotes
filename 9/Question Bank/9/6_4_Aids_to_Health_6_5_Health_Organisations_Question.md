## Section C: Short Answer Questions

1.  **Active immunity** is acquired through exposure to a pathogen or vaccination, leading to the production of antibodies and memory cells, providing long-term protection. For example, recovering from measles provides active immunity. **Passive immunity** is acquired by receiving antibodies from an external source, such as from mother to fetus or through an injection of antibodies, providing immediate but short-term protection. An example is a baby receiving antibodies from its mother's breast milk.
2.  **Vaccination** is the process of administering a vaccine, which contains a weakened or inactivated form of a pathogen or its toxins, to stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies and memory cells. This prepares the body to fight off future infections by that pathogen, preventing disease. For example, the MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps, and rubella.
3.  **Antitoxins** are antibodies that neutralize specific toxins produced by bacteria or other organisms. They are used in treating poisoning cases, such as tetanus or botulism, by binding to the toxins and preventing them from damaging the body's cells. For example, tetanus antitoxin is given to individuals with a tetanus infection to neutralize the tetanus toxin.
4.  **Serum**, the liquid portion of blood after clotting, is crucial in medical diagnosis and treatment. It contains antibodies, hormones, and other proteins that can be analyzed to diagnose diseases. For example, blood tests use serum to detect antibodies against viruses like HIV. In treatment, serum from an immune individual can be used to provide passive immunity to another person.
5.  **Antiseptics** are used on living tissues to reduce the possibility of infection, sepsis, or putrefaction. An example is using iodine to clean a wound. **Disinfectants** are used on inanimate objects to destroy microorganisms. An example is using bleach to clean a countertop. The main difference is that antiseptics are safe for skin, while disinfectants are generally too harsh.
6.  **Antibiotics** work by either killing bacteria (bactericidal) or inhibiting their growth (bacteriostatic). They target specific structures or processes in bacteria, such as cell wall synthesis. **Antibiotic resistance** is a major concern because overuse and misuse of antibiotics have led to the evolution of bacteria that are no longer affected by these drugs, making infections harder to treat.
7.  The **local defense system** consists of physical and chemical barriers that prevent pathogens from entering the body. The **skin** acts as a physical barrier. **Mucous membranes** line body cavities and trap pathogens. **Cilia** in the respiratory tract sweep out mucus and trapped pathogens. These components work together as the first line of defense against infection.
8.  **WHO** plays a central role in global health governance by setting norms and standards, providing leadership on global health matters, shaping the health research agenda, and monitoring and assessing health trends. For example, WHO coordinated the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, providing guidance and support to countries worldwide.
9.  The **Red Cross movement** provides humanitarian protection and assistance for victims of war and other situations of violence. Its work is guided by the fundamental principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity, and universality. For example, the Red Cross provides medical care, food, and shelter to people affected by natural disasters and conflicts.
10. **WHO** is a specialized agency of the **United Nations** and is responsible for international public health. It works closely with other UN agencies to address global health challenges. For example, WHO collaborates with UNICEF to deliver vaccines to children in developing countries.
11. The **skin** functions as a protective barrier by providing a tough, waterproof layer that prevents pathogens from entering the body. The outer layer of the skin, the epidermis, is constantly shedding, which helps to remove any pathogens that may be on the surface. The skin also has a slightly acidic pH, which inhibits the growth of many microorganisms.
12. **Mucous membranes** line the respiratory, digestive, and urogenital tracts and serve as a protective barrier. They secrete mucus, a sticky substance that traps pathogens and prevents them from reaching the underlying tissues. The mucus also contains enzymes and antibodies that can kill or inactivate pathogens.
13. **Cilia** are tiny, hair-like structures that line the respiratory tract. They beat in a coordinated fashion to move mucus and trapped pathogens up and out of the respiratory tract, where they can be coughed up or swallowed. This helps to prevent respiratory infections.
14. **Active immunity** provides long-lasting, often lifelong, protection, but it takes time to develop. **Passive immunity** provides immediate but temporary protection. **Natural immunity** is acquired through infection, while **artificial immunity** is acquired through vaccination. The most effective type of immunity depends on the specific situation.
15. **Ethical considerations** in vaccination programs include informed consent, balancing individual autonomy with public health goals, ensuring equitable access to vaccines, and addressing concerns about vaccine safety. For example, mandatory vaccination policies raise ethical questions about individual liberty versus the collective good.
16. **Herd immunity** occurs when a large portion of a community becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of the disease from person to person unlikely. This protects the entire community, including those who are not immune themselves. For example, high vaccination rates for measles protect infants who are too young to be vaccinated.
17. When an **antigen** enters the body, it is recognized by B cells, a type of white blood cell. The B cells then differentiate into plasma cells, which produce **antibodies**. Antibodies are proteins that bind to the antigen and mark it for destruction by other immune cells.
18. **WHO** faces several challenges in global health emergencies, including a lack of funding, political interference, and the difficulty of coordinating a response in complex and often chaotic situations. For example, during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, WHO was criticized for its slow response.
19. The **Red Cross** plays a vital role in disaster management by providing immediate relief to affected populations, including food, water, shelter, and medical care. It also helps communities to prepare for and recover from disasters. For example, after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the Red Cross provided assistance to millions of people.
20. **International humanitarian law (IHL)** is a set of rules that seek to limit the effects of armed conflict. It protects people who are not or are no longer participating in the hostilities and restricts the means and methods of warfare. IHL is important because it helps to reduce suffering and protect human dignity in times of war.
21. **Immunological memory** is the ability of the immune system to remember a specific pathogen and mount a faster and more effective response upon subsequent exposure. This is due to the presence of memory cells, which are long-lived B and T cells that are specific for that pathogen.
22. There are several types of **vaccines**, including live-attenuated vaccines, inactivated vaccines, subunit vaccines, and toxoid vaccines. **Live-attenuated vaccines** contain a weakened form of the pathogen. **Inactivated vaccines** contain a killed form of the pathogen. **Subunit vaccines** contain only a part of the pathogen. **Toxoid vaccines** contain a toxin produced by the pathogen that has been inactivated.
23. **Antiseptics** are crucial in surgical procedures to prevent surgical site infections. They are used to clean the patient's skin before surgery and to sterilize surgical instruments. For example, povidone-iodine is a common antiseptic used in surgery.
24. **Antibiotics** should be used only when necessary and as prescribed by a doctor. Overuse and misuse of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance. It is important to complete the full course of antibiotics, even if you start to feel better, to ensure that all of the bacteria are killed.
25. **Antimicrobial resistance (AMR)** occurs when microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites change in ways that render the medications used to cure the infections they cause ineffective. When the microorganisms become resistant to most antimicrobials they are often referred to as “superbugs”. This is a major public health concern because it can make infections very difficult to treat.
26. When a foreign **antigen** enters the body, it is recognized by the immune system as non-self. This triggers an immune response, which involves the production of antibodies and the activation of T cells. The antibodies bind to the antigen and mark it for destruction, while the T cells directly kill the infected cells.
27. **Infection control** is essential in hospitals to prevent the spread of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). This includes measures such as hand hygiene, wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), and cleaning and disinfecting surfaces. For example, hospitals have strict protocols for cleaning patient rooms to prevent the spread of infections.
28. **WHO** sets international health standards by developing evidence-based guidelines and recommendations on a wide range of health issues. These standards are used by countries to develop their own national health policies and programs. For example, WHO has set standards for drinking water quality and for the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis.
29. The **Red Cross** principles of **neutrality** and **impartiality** are essential for its humanitarian work. **Neutrality** means that the Red Cross does not take sides in conflicts. **Impartiality** means that the Red Cross provides assistance based on need, without discrimination. These principles allow the Red Cross to access and assist people in need, even in the most difficult and dangerous situations.
30. **Public health emergency preparedness** is the process of planning for and responding to public health emergencies, such as disease outbreaks, natural disasters, and terrorist attacks. This includes developing plans, training personnel, and stockpiling supplies. For example, countries have pandemic preparedness plans to respond to an influenza pandemic.
31. **Disease surveillance** is the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data needed for the planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice. It is important for detecting and responding to disease outbreaks, monitoring trends in disease, and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures.
32. **Health disparities** are differences in health outcomes between different groups of people. These disparities can be caused by a variety of factors, including socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, and geographic location. For example, people with low incomes are more likely to have chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes.
33. **Health promotion** is the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve, their health. It involves a wide range of activities, including health education, policy changes, and environmental improvements. For example, a health promotion campaign might encourage people to eat a healthy diet and get regular exercise.
34. **Primary healthcare (PHC)** is a whole-of-society approach to health that aims at ensuring the highest possible level of health and well-being and their equitable distribution by focusing on people’s needs and as early as possible along the continuum from health promotion and disease prevention to treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care, and as close as feasible to people’s everyday environment.
35. **Health system strengthening** is the process of improving the performance of a health system. This includes improving the six building blocks of a health system: service delivery, health workforce, health information systems, access to essential medicines, financing, and leadership/governance.
36. **Global health governance** faces several challenges, including a lack of funding, political interference, and the difficulty of coordinating a response in a complex and often chaotic global landscape. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the challenges of global health governance.
37. **Community participation** is essential for the success of health programs. When communities are involved in the planning and implementation of health programs, they are more likely to be successful and sustainable. For example, community health workers can play a vital role in delivering health services to remote and underserved populations.
38. **Health equity** means that everyone has a fair and just opportunity to be as healthy as possible. This requires removing obstacles to health such as poverty, discrimination, and their consequences, including powerlessness and lack of access to good jobs with fair pay, quality education and housing, safe environments, and health care. **Social determinants of health** are the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age. These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power and resources at global, national and local levels.
39. **Health information systems (HIS)** are essential for the planning, implementation, and evaluation of health programs. HIS collect, analyze, and disseminate health data, which is used to make decisions about how to improve health.

## Section D: Broad Answer Questions

1.  **Active immunity** is acquired when an individual's own immune system produces antibodies in response to an antigen, either through natural infection or vaccination. This process leads to the formation of memory cells, providing long-term, often lifelong, protection. For example, recovering from chickenpox confers active immunity. In contrast, **passive immunity** is acquired by receiving pre-made antibodies from an external source, such as from a mother to her fetus through the placenta or through an injection of immune globulin. This provides immediate but temporary protection, as the borrowed antibodies are eventually broken down and not replaced. An example is a baby receiving antibodies from its mother's milk. Active immunity is used for long-term prevention of diseases, while passive immunity is used for immediate protection after exposure to a pathogen.
2.  **WHO** plays a crucial role in global health governance by setting international health standards, providing leadership on global health matters, shaping the health research agenda, and monitoring and assessing health trends. It also provides technical support to countries and coordinates the international response to health emergencies. However, WHO faces challenges such as insufficient funding, political pressure from member states, and difficulties in enforcing its recommendations. A prominent example of WHO's role is its coordination of the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, where it provided guidance on testing, treatment, and vaccination, despite facing criticism for its initial handling of the outbreak.
3.  The **Red Cross movement** operates under the fundamental principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity, and universality. These principles guide its humanitarian work in conflict zones and disaster areas. **Humanity** means that the Red Cross strives to prevent and alleviate human suffering. **Impartiality** means that it provides assistance based on need, without discrimination. **Neutrality** means that it does not take sides in hostilities or engage in controversies of a political, racial, religious, or ideological nature. Maintaining neutrality and impartiality can be challenging in highly politicized conflicts, where the Red Cross may be accused of favoring one side over another.
4.  A comprehensive approach to **infection control** involves the use of antiseptics, disinfectants, and antibiotics. **Antiseptics** are used on living tissue to reduce the risk of infection. **Disinfectants** are used on inanimate objects to kill microorganisms. **Antibiotics** are used to treat bacterial infections. The emergence of **antimicrobial resistance (AMR)**, where microorganisms evolve to resist the effects of drugs, is a major global threat. Strategies to address AMR include promoting the responsible use of antibiotics, developing new drugs, and improving infection control measures in healthcare settings.
5.  The **local defense system** is the body's first line of defense against infection. It consists of physical barriers, such as the **skin** and **mucous membranes**, and chemical barriers, such as the **acidic environment of the stomach**. The skin provides a tough, waterproof barrier, while mucous membranes trap pathogens. If these barriers are compromised, for example by a cut in the skin, pathogens can enter the body and cause infection. The body's subsequent immune response involves inflammation, the recruitment of white blood cells to the site of infection, and the production of antibodies.
6.  **Vaccination programs** are a cornerstone of public health, preventing millions of deaths each year. They work by creating **herd immunity**, where a large proportion of the population is immune to a disease, making it difficult for the disease to spread. However, **vaccine hesitancy**, fueled by misinformation and mistrust, poses a significant challenge to vaccination programs. Healthcare providers play a crucial role in promoting vaccination by providing accurate information and addressing patients' concerns. A successful example is the global eradication of smallpox through a coordinated vaccination campaign led by WHO.
7.  **Immunization** is the process of making a person immune to an infectious disease, typically by vaccination. It has had a profound impact on global health, leading to the eradication of smallpox and the near-eradication of polio. However, challenges remain in vaccine distribution, particularly in developing countries, due to factors such as poverty, conflict, and weak health systems. Strategies to improve vaccination coverage include strengthening health systems, improving supply chains, and using innovative delivery methods, such as mobile vaccination clinics.
8.  **Serum**, the liquid component of blood, is vital for medical diagnostics and treatment. It contains a wealth of information, including antibodies, hormones, and proteins, which can be used to diagnose a wide range of diseases, from infections to cancer. Serum is collected by drawing blood and allowing it to clot. In treatment, serum from an immune individual can be used to provide passive immunity to another person, a therapy known as **convalescent plasma therapy**. This has been used to treat various infectious diseases, including COVID-19.
9.  **International humanitarian law (IHL)** is a set of rules that aims to limit the effects of armed conflict. It protects people who are not or are no longer participating in hostilities, such as civilians, medical personnel, and aid workers. It also restricts the means and methods of warfare. The **Red Cross** plays a key role in promoting compliance with IHL by monitoring violations, providing training to armed forces, and advocating for the protection of civilians. However, enforcement of IHL remains a major challenge, as there is no international police force to enforce its rules.
10. **Health emergency preparedness** is the process of planning for and responding to public health emergencies.
