## Section C: Short Answer Questions

1.  The six main classes of food are carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water. Carbohydrates provide energy, proteins are needed for growth and repair, fats provide energy and insulation, vitamins and minerals are needed for various bodily functions, and water is essential for all bodily functions.
2.  A balanced diet is important for maintaining good health. It provides the body with all the nutrients it needs to function properly. A lack of a balanced diet can lead to malnutrition and various health problems.
3.  The four types of teeth are incisors, canines, premolars, and molars. Incisors are used for biting, canines are used for tearing, premolars are used for crushing, and molars are used for grinding.
4.  The structure of a tooth consists of the crown, which is the visible part of the tooth, and the root, which is embedded in the jawbone. The crown is covered by enamel, which is the hardest substance in the body. Underneath the enamel is the dentin, which is a bone-like substance. The pulp is the soft, inner part of the tooth that contains nerves and blood vessels.
5.  The main organs of the digestive system are the mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. The accessory organs are the salivary glands, liver, and pancreas.
6.  The process of digestion begins in the mouth, where food is chewed and mixed with saliva. The food then travels down the oesophagus to the stomach, where it is mixed with gastric juice. The food then moves to the small intestine, where it is mixed with bile and pancreatic juice. The nutrients are then absorbed into the bloodstream and the waste products are eliminated from the body through the large intestine.
7.  The liver produces bile, which helps to digest fats. It also detoxifies the blood and stores glycogen. The pancreas produces enzymes that digest carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. It also produces the hormones insulin and glucagon, which regulate blood sugar levels.
8.  The small intestine is the main site of digestion and absorption of nutrients. It is lined with villi, which are small, finger-like projections that increase the surface area for absorption.
9.  The large intestine absorbs water and electrolytes and stores feces. It is also home to a large number of bacteria that help to break down undigested food.
10. The three main enzymes involved in digestion are amylase, which digests carbohydrates; protease, which digests proteins; and lipase, which digests fats.

2.  The digestive system is regulated by the nervous system and the endocrine system. The nervous system controls the movement of food through the digestive tract, while the endocrine system releases hormones that regulate the production of digestive juices. The main hormones that regulate digestion are gastrin, secretin, and cholecystokinin (CCK).
3.  The digestive system is essential for providing the body with the nutrients it needs to function properly. The nutrients from food are used for energy, growth, and repair. The digestive system also plays a role in the immune system, as it helps to protect the body from infection.
4.  The digestive system is related to other body systems in a number of ways. The circulatory system transports nutrients from the digestive system to the rest of the body. The respiratory system provides the oxygen that is needed for cellular respiration, which is the process by which cells break down glucose to release energy. The excretory system removes waste products from the body, including the waste products of digestion. The immune system helps to protect the body from infection. The muscular system is responsible for the movement of food through the digestive tract. The skeletal system provides support for the digestive organs. The integumentary system (skin) protects the body from the outside world. The reproductive system is responsible for the production of offspring. The lymphatic system is a network of vessels and tissues that helps to remove waste products from the body. The endocrine system is a system of glands that produce hormones. The nervous system is a system of nerves that transmit signals between different parts of the body.
5.  Some common digestive disorders include heartburn, ulcers, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Heartburn is a burning sensation in the chest that is caused by stomach acid backing up into the oesophagus. Ulcers are sores in the lining of the stomach or small intestine. IBS is a condition that affects the large intestine and can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea.
6.  To maintain a healthy digestive system, it is important to eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and manage stress. A balanced diet should include a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. It is also important to drink plenty of water. Exercise helps to keep the digestive system moving and can help to prevent constipation. Stress can also affect the digestive system, so it is important to find ways to manage stress, such as through yoga or meditation.
7.  The digestive system breaks down food into nutrients that can be absorbed by the body. These nutrients are then used for energy, growth, and repair. The digestive system is a complex system that is essential for maintaining good health.
8.  The digestive system is made up of the mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. The accessory organs of the digestive system are the salivary glands, liver, and pancreas. The process of digestion begins in the mouth, where food is chewed and mixed with saliva. The food then travels down the oesophagus to the stomach, where it is mixed with gastric juice. The food then moves to the small intestine, where it is mixed with bile and pancreatic juice. The nutrients are then absorbed into the bloodstream and the waste products are eliminated from the body through the large intestine.
