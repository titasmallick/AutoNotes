## Section D: Long Answer Questions

1.  The skin is composed of three layers: the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis. The epidermis is the outermost layer and provides a waterproof barrier. The dermis is the middle layer and contains connective tissue, hair follicles, and sweat glands. The hypodermis is the deepest layer and is made of fat and connective tissue. Together, these layers protect the body from injury, infection, and dehydration. They also regulate body temperature and provide sensation.
2.  The skin plays a vital role in thermoregulation. When the body is hot, blood vessels in the skin dilate, allowing more blood to flow to the surface and release heat. Sweat glands also produce sweat, which cools the body as it evaporates. When the body is cold, blood vessels in the skin constrict, reducing blood flow to the surface and conserving heat. The arrector pili muscles also contract, causing the hair to stand on end and trap a layer of warm air next to the skin.
3.  Skin appendages include hair, nails, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, and mammary glands. Hair provides insulation and protection. Nails protect the tips of the fingers and toes. Sweat glands produce sweat, which cools the body. Sebaceous glands produce sebum, which keeps the skin moist. Mammary glands produce milk to nourish offspring.
4.  The skin develops from the ectoderm, mesoderm, and neural crest cells. The epidermis develops from the ectoderm, the dermis develops from the mesoderm, and the melanocytes develop from the neural crest cells. Skin appendages, such as hair and nails, also develop from the ectoderm.
5.  The skin is a barrier organ that protects the body from the environment. The epidermis provides a physical barrier against injury and infection. The dermis contains immune cells that help to fight infection. The skin also has a chemical barrier, with a low pH that inhibits the growth of bacteria.
