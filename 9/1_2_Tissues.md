# Tissues

A tissue is a group of similar cells that work together to perform a specific function.

## Plant Tissues

*   **Parenchyma:**
    *   **Location:** Found throughout the plant, in the cortex, pith, and mesophyll.
    *   **Structure:** Thin-walled, isodiametric cells with intercellular spaces.
    *   **Function:** Storage, photosynthesis, and secretion.
*   **Collenchyma:**
    *   **Location:** Found in the epidermis and vascular bundles of young stems and leaves.
    *   **Structure:** Elongated cells with unevenly thickened walls.
    *   **Function:** Provides support and flexibility.
*   **Sclerenchyma:**
    *   **Location:** Found in the stems, roots, and leaves.
    *   **Structure:** Thick-walled, lignified cells.
    *   **Function:** Provides support and protection.

## Animal Tissues

*   **Epithelial Tissue:**
    *   **Location:** Covers the body surface and lines the internal organs.
    *   **Structure:** Tightly packed cells with little intercellular space.
    *   **Function:** Protection, secretion, and absorption.
*   **Connective Tissue:**
    *   **Location:** Found throughout the body, connecting and supporting other tissues.
    *   **Structure:** Cells scattered in an extracellular matrix.
    *   **Function:** Support, protection, and transport.
*   **Muscular Tissue:**
    *   **Location:** Found in the muscles.
    *   **Structure:** Elongated cells that can contract.
    *   **Function:** Movement.
*   **Nervous Tissue:**
    *   **Location:** Found in the brain, spinal cord, and nerves.
    *   **Structure:** Neurons and glial cells.
    *   **Function:** Communication and coordination.
