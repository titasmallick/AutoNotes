# Digestive System

## Organs and Glands

*   **Mouth:** Where digestion begins.
*   **Esophagus:** A tube that connects the mouth to the stomach.
*   **Stomach:** A muscular organ that churns food and mixes it with digestive juices.
*   **Small Intestine:** A long, coiled tube where most of the digestion and absorption of nutrients takes place.
*   **Large Intestine:** A shorter, wider tube where water is absorbed from the remaining food.
*   **Rectum:** The final section of the large intestine, terminating at the anus.
*   **Anus:** The opening at the end of the digestive tract through which solid waste matter leaves the body.
*   **Salivary Glands:** Glands that produce saliva, which contains enzymes that begin the digestion of carbohydrates.
*   **Liver:** Produces bile, which helps to digest fats.
*   **Gallbladder:** Stores bile.
*   **Pancreas:** Produces enzymes that digest carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.

## Digestion, Absorption, and Assimilation

*   **Digestion:** The process of breaking down food into smaller molecules that can be absorbed by the body.
*   **Absorption:** The process by which nutrients from digested food are taken into the bloodstream.
*   **Assimilation:** The process by which the absorbed nutrients are used by the body for growth, energy, and repair.

## Peristalsis

Peristalsis is the wave-like muscular contractions that move food through the digestive tract.
