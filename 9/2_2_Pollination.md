# Pollination

Pollination is the transfer of pollen from a male part of a plant to a female part of a plant, later enabling fertilisation and the production of seeds, most often by an animal or by wind.

## Self-Pollination and Cross-Pollination

*   **Self-Pollination:** The transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma of the same flower or another flower on the same plant.
    *   **Advantages:** It is a sure method of pollination and preserves the parental characters.
    *   **Disadvantages:** It does not produce new varieties and the offspring are less vigorous.
*   **Cross-Pollination:** The transfer of pollen from the anther of a flower on one plant to the stigma of a flower on another plant of the same species.
    *   **Advantages:** It produces new varieties and the offspring are more vigorous.
    *   **Disadvantages:** It is not a sure method of pollination and it depends on external agents.

## Agents of Pollination

*   **Insects:** Flowers pollinated by insects are usually large, brightly colored, and have a sweet scent.
*   **Wind:** Flowers pollinated by wind are usually small, inconspicuous, and do not have a scent.
*   **Water:** Flowers pollinated by water are usually small and inconspicuous.

## Natural Adaptations for Cross-Pollination

*   **Unisexuality:** The presence of either male or female reproductive organs in a flower.
*   **Dichogamy:** The maturation of the androecium and gynoecium at different times.
*   **Self-sterility:** The inability of a flower to be fertilized by its own pollen.
*   **Herkogamy:** The spatial separation of the anther and stigma.
