# Food Classes & Balanced Diet: A Comprehensive Guide

This note expands on the essential concepts of food classes, balanced diet, malnutrition, and deficiency diseases, providing detailed insights into each topic as outlined in the syllabus.

## 1. Classes of Food (Macronutrients and Micronutrients)

Food is broadly categorized into macronutrients and micronutrients, each playing a vital role in the body's proper functioning.

### 1.1 Macronutrients

These are required in large quantities and provide energy and building blocks for the body.

#### 1.1.1 Carbohydrates
*   **Functions:**
    *   **Primary Energy Source:** Carbohydrates are the body's main source of energy, especially for the brain and muscles. Glucose, a simple sugar derived from carbohydrates, is the preferred fuel for most cells.
    *   **Energy Storage:** Excess glucose can be stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles for later use.
    *   **Protein Sparing:** Adequate carbohydrate intake prevents the body from breaking down proteins for energy, thus allowing proteins to perform their essential functions like building and repairing tissues.
    *   **Preventing Ketosis:** Sufficient carbohydrates prevent the body from producing acidic ketone bodies, which can occur when fat is used as the primary energy source due to insufficient glucose.
*   **Sources:** Grains (rice, wheat, oats), bread, pasta, potatoes, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and sugars.

#### 1.1.2 Fats (Lipids)
*   **Functions:**
    *   **Concentrated Energy Source:** Fats provide more than double the energy content per gram compared to carbohydrates or proteins, serving as an important energy reserve.
    *   **Insulation and Protection:** Fats insulate the body, helping to maintain body temperature, and protect vital organs from shock and injury.
    *   **Cell Membrane Component:** They are crucial components of cell membranes, contributing to their structure and regulating fluidity.
    *   **Hormone Production:** Fats are involved in the production and regulation of various hormones, including those important for reproductive health.
    *   **Absorption of Fat-Soluble Vitamins:** Dietary fats are essential for the absorption and transport of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K).
    *   **Nerve Function:** Fats are important for brain activity, forming nerve cell membranes, insulating neurons, and facilitating electrical impulse signaling.
    *   **Flavor and Satiety:** Fats contribute to the taste and texture of food and promote a feeling of fullness after meals.
*   **Sources:** Oils (vegetable, olive, coconut), butter, nuts, seeds, avocados, fatty fish (salmon, mackerel), and dairy products.

#### 1.1.3 Proteins
*   **Functions:**
    *   **Building and Repairing Tissues:** Proteins are fundamental for the growth, maintenance, and repair of all body tissues, including muscles, organs, skin, and hair.
    *   **Enzyme Production:** Many proteins act as enzymes, which are biological catalysts that facilitate nearly all chemical reactions in the body, including digestion and metabolism.
    *   **Hormone Production:** Some hormones, which act as chemical messengers, are proteins (e.g., insulin).
    *   **Structural Support:** Proteins like keratin (in hair and nails) and collagen (in skin, bones, and tendons) provide structural support.
    *   **Transport and Storage:** Transport proteins carry substances (e.g., oxygen via hemoglobin, nutrients, cholesterol) throughout the bloodstream and within cells. Storage proteins store essential substances (e.g., ferritin stores iron).
    *   **Immune Function:** Antibodies, which are proteins, play a crucial role in the immune system by identifying and neutralizing foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses.
    *   **Fluid and pH Balance:** Proteins help maintain proper fluid balance and regulate pH levels in the body.
    *   **Energy Source (Secondary):** While not their primary role, proteins can be used as an energy source if carbohydrate and fat intake is insufficient.
*   **Sources:** Meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, legumes (beans, lentils), nuts, and seeds.

### 1.2 Micronutrients

These are required in smaller quantities but are essential for various metabolic processes and overall health.

#### 1.2.1 Mineral Salts
Mineral salts are inorganic substances vital for numerous bodily functions.
