# Respiration in Plants: The Energy of Life

## Introduction: Why Do Plants Respire?

Just like animals, plants are living organisms that need a constant supply of energy to carry out their life processes, such as growth, absorption of minerals, and transport of substances. **Respiration** is the biochemical process of breaking down organic food (primarily glucose) to release this energy in a usable form, as **ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)**. This process occurs in every living cell of the plant, 24 hours a day.

It is important not to confuse respiration with photosynthesis. They are, in many ways, opposite processes:

| Feature | Photosynthesis | Respiration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Process** | Anabolic (builds up glucose) | Catabolic (breaks down glucose) |
| **Energy** | Stores energy from sunlight | Releases chemical energy |
| **Location** | Occurs in chloroplasts | Occurs in cytoplasm and mitochondria |
| **Time** | Occurs only in the presence of light | Occurs continuously (day and night) |
| **Gases** | Uses Carbon Dioxide (CO2), releases Oxygen (O2) | Uses Oxygen (O2), releases Carbon Dioxide (CO2) |

## Gaseous Exchange in Plants

Plants need to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide during respiration. Unlike animals, plants do not have a specialized respiratory system. Instead, gaseous exchange occurs through different structures in different parts of the plant.

*   **In Leaves:** Gaseous exchange occurs through tiny pores called **stomata** on the leaf surface. Oxygen diffuses into the leaf cells, and carbon dioxide diffuses out.
*   **In Stems:** In woody stems, the bark has special openings called **lenticels**, which are porous tissues that allow for the exchange of gases between the internal tissues and the atmosphere.
*   **In Roots:** The root cells take in oxygen from the air spaces present in the soil. The exchange occurs across the moist surface of the root hairs by diffusion.

## Outline of the Respiration Process

The complete breakdown of one molecule of glucose to release energy is a complex, multi-step process. It can be broadly divided into two main phases: Glycolysis and the Krebs Cycle.

### 1. Glycolysis (The First Step)

*   **Location:** Cytoplasm of the cell.
*   **Process:** Glycolysis means "splitting of sugar." In this stage, one molecule of glucose (a 6-carbon compound) is broken down into two molecules of **pyruvic acid** (a 3-carbon compound).
*   **Oxygen Requirement:** This process **does not require oxygen** and is common to both aerobic and anaerobic respiration.
*   **Significance:** It is the initial stage of respiration that begins the breakdown of glucose and produces a small amount of energy (2 ATP molecules) and pyruvic acid, which can then enter the next stage if oxygen is available.

### 2. Krebs Cycle (The Citric Acid Cycle)

*   **Location:** Mitochondria of the cell.
*   **Process:** This stage only occurs if **oxygen is present**. The pyruvic acid produced during glycolysis enters the mitochondria and is completely broken down in a series of cyclic reactions. This process releases carbon dioxide, a large amount of chemical energy (captured in molecules like NADH and FADH2), and a small amount of ATP.
*   **Significance:** The Krebs cycle is the main energy-releasing phase of aerobic respiration. It completely oxidizes the glucose molecule, releasing the stored energy and producing carbon dioxide as a waste product. The high-energy molecules produced here go on to a final step (the Electron Transport Chain) to produce the majority of the cell's ATP.

## Types of Respiration

### 1. Aerobic Respiration

This is the most common form of respiration and occurs in the **presence of oxygen**. It involves the complete breakdown of glucose into carbon dioxide and water, releasing a large amount of energy (approximately 38 ATP molecules from one glucose molecule).

**Chemical Equation:**

C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + 38 ATP (Energy)
(Glucose + Oxygen → Carbon Dioxide + Water + Energy)

### 2. Anaerobic Respiration (Fermentation)

This type of respiration occurs in the **absence of oxygen**. It is an incomplete breakdown of glucose. In plants and yeast, this process is called **alcoholic fermentation**.

Here, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis is further broken down into **ethanol (ethyl alcohol)** and **carbon dioxide**. It releases a much smaller amount of energy (only 2 ATP molecules from one glucose molecule).

**Chemical Equation (in Plants/Yeast):**

C₆H₁₂O₆ → 2C₂H₅OH + 2CO₂ + 2 ATP (Energy)
(Glucose → Ethanol + Carbon Dioxide + Energy)

## Experiments on Respiration

### 1. Experiment to Show that Carbon Dioxide is Produced During Respiration

*   **Apparatus:** Two flasks (A and B), germinating bean seeds, boiled/dead bean seeds, a beaker of limewater (calcium hydroxide solution).
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  In Flask A (experimental setup), place a handful of live, germinating bean seeds.
    2.  In Flask B (control setup), place an equal amount of boiled (and cooled) bean seeds. Adding a few drops of an antiseptic like carbolic acid prevents decay.
    3.  Cork both flasks and leave them for a few hours.
    4.  After some time, pass the gas from each flask through a test tube containing limewater.
*   **Observation:** The gas from Flask A turns the limewater milky (a white precipitate of calcium carbonate is formed). The gas from Flask B shows no change.
*   **Conclusion:** This proves that germinating seeds (which are actively respiring) produce carbon dioxide.

### 2. Experiment to Show that Heat is Produced During Respiration

*   **Apparatus:** Two thermos flasks (A and B), germinating seeds, boiled/dead seeds, two thermometers.
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Take a handful of germinating seeds and place them in Thermos Flask A. Insert a thermometer so its bulb is surrounded by the seeds. Seal the mouth of the flask with cotton wool.
    2.  In Thermos Flask B (control), take an equal quantity of boiled (dead) seeds. Also, insert a thermometer and seal the mouth.
    3.  Record the initial temperature in both flasks.
    4.  Observe the temperature readings after a few hours.
*   **Observation:** The thermometer in Flask A shows a significant rise in temperature. The thermometer in Flask B shows no change in temperature.
*   **Conclusion:** This demonstrates that germinating seeds produce heat during the process of respiration.
