# Respiration in Plants

Respiration is the process by which plants break down glucose to release energy.

## Glycolysis and Krebs Cycle

*   **Glycolysis:** The breakdown of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. It occurs in the cytoplasm and does not require oxygen.
*   **Krebs Cycle:** A series of chemical reactions that release stored energy through the oxidation of acetyl-CoA derived from carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into carbon dioxide and chemical energy in the form of ATP. It occurs in the mitochondria and requires oxygen.

## Aerobic vs. Anaerobic Respiration

*   **Aerobic Respiration:** The breakdown of glucose in the presence of oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, water, and energy.
    *   **Equation:** C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + 38 ATP
*   **Anaerobic Respiration:** The breakdown of glucose in the absence of oxygen to produce ethanol, carbon dioxide, and energy.
    *   **Equation:** C₆H₁₂O₆ → 2C₂H₅OH + 2CO₂ + 2 ATP

## Experiments

*   **To show that heat is produced during respiration:** Place some germinating seeds in a thermos flask and insert a thermometer. The temperature will rise.
*   **To show that carbon dioxide is produced during respiration:** Place some germinating seeds in a test tube with lime water. The lime water will turn milky.
