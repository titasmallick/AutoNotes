# Structure of Seeds & Germination

## Seed Structure

*   **Bean (Dicot):**
    *   **Seed Coat:** The outer protective layer of the seed.
    *   **Hilum:** A scar on the seed coat where the seed was attached to the fruit.
    *   **Micropyle:** A small opening in the seed coat through which the pollen tube entered.
    *   **Cotyledons:** Two fleshy leaves that store food for the embryo.
    *   **Embryo:** The young plant that develops from the zygote.
*   **Maize (Monocot):**
    *   **Seed Coat:** Fused with the fruit wall.
    *   **Endosperm:** A nutritive tissue that surrounds the embryo.
    *   **Cotyledon:** A single, shield-shaped cotyledon called the scutellum.
    *   **Embryo:** Consists of a plumule (shoot) and a radicle (root).

## Germination

Germination is the process by which a plant grows from a seed.

### Types of Germination

*   **Hypogeal Germination:** The cotyledons remain below the ground.
*   **Epigeal Germination:** The cotyledons are pushed above the ground.

### Conditions for Germination

*   **Water:** Needed for the activation of enzymes and the transport of food.
*   **Oxygen:** Needed for respiration.
*   **Temperature:** The optimum temperature for germination varies from species to species.

### Experiments

*   **To show that water is necessary for germination:** Place some seeds on a dry cotton wool and some on a wet cotton wool. Only the seeds on the wet cotton wool will germinate.
*   **To show that oxygen is necessary for germination:** Place some seeds in a flask with water and some in a flask with pyrogallic acid (which absorbs oxygen). Only the seeds in the flask with water will germinate.
*   **To show that temperature is necessary for germination:** Place some seeds in a refrigerator and some at room temperature. Only the seeds at room temperature will germinate.
