# The Cell â€“ A Unit of Life

## Cell Theory

The cell theory states that:

1.  All living organisms are composed of one or more cells.
2.  The cell is the basic unit of structure and function in organisms.
3.  Cells arise from pre-existing cells.

## Protoplasm and Cytoplasm

*   **Protoplasm:** The living content of a cell that is surrounded by a plasma membrane.
*   **Cytoplasm:** The material or protoplasm within a living cell, excluding the nucleus.

## Differences

### Prokaryotic vs. Eukaryotic Cells

| Feature | Prokaryotic Cell | Eukaryotic Cell |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nucleus** | Absent | Present |
| **Membrane-bound Organelles** | Absent | Present |
| **Cell Wall** | Usually present | Present in plants and fungi |
| **Ribosomes** | 70S | 80S |
| **Example** | Bacteria | Plants, animals |

### Plant vs. Animal Cells

| Feature | Plant Cell | Animal Cell |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cell Wall** | Present | Absent |
| **Plastids** | Present | Absent |
| **Vacuoles** | Large central vacuole | Small, temporary vacuoles |
| **Centrosome** | Absent | Present |

## Structure and Function of Cell Organelles

*   **Nucleus:** Controls the cell's activities and contains the genetic material.
*   **Nucleolus:** A small, dense structure in the nucleus that is involved in ribosome synthesis.
*   **Cell Membrane:** A thin, flexible barrier that surrounds the cell and controls what enters and leaves.
*   **Mitochondria:** The "powerhouses" of the cell, where cellular respiration takes place.
*   **Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):** A network of membranes that is involved in protein and lipid synthesis.
*   **Ribosomes:** The sites of protein synthesis.
*   **Golgi Bodies:** A stack of flattened sacs that is involved in modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins.
*   **Plastids:** A group of organelles that are found in plant cells and are involved in photosynthesis and storage.
*   **Lysosomes:** Small, spherical organelles that contain enzymes that break down waste products.
*   **Centrosome:** An organelle that is involved in cell division.
*   **Vacuole:** A large, water-filled sac that is found in plant cells and is involved in storage and support.
