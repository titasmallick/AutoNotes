# Flower

A flower is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms).

## Structure of a Bisexual Flower

A bisexual flower has both male and female reproductive organs.

*   **Calyx:** The outermost whorl of a flower, consisting of sepals.
*   **Corolla:** The whorl of a flower inside the calyx, consisting of petals.
*   **Androecium:** The male reproductive organ of a flower, consisting of stamens.
*   **Gynoecium:** The female reproductive organ of a flower, consisting of carpels.

## Whorls

*   **Essential Whorls:** The androecium and gynoecium, which are directly involved in reproduction.
*   **Non-essential Whorls:** The calyx and corolla, which are not directly involved in reproduction.

## Flower Types

*   **Complete Flower:** A flower that has all four whorls.
*   **Incomplete Flower:** A flower that is missing one or more whorls.

## Inflorescence and Placentation

*   **Inflorescence:** A group or cluster of flowers arranged on a stem that is composed of a main branch or a complicated arrangement of branches.
*   **Placentation:** The arrangement of ovules within the ovary.
